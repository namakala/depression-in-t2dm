BACKGROUND: Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2).() Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. It is also associated with depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is also associated with higher all-cause mortality at any age, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors like smoking. A person with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) has about a 50% higher risk of dying than does someone with a healthy BMI. The risk more than doubles at a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). An expert estimated that about 160,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. In the United States, the prevalence of morbid obesity is 4.7% (1999-2000). In Ontario, the 2004 Chief Medical Officer of Health Report said that in 2003, almost one-half of Ontario adults were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). About 57% of Ontario men and 42% of Ontario women were overweight or obese. The proportion of the population that was overweight or obese increased gradually from 44% in 1990 to 49% in 2000, and it appears to have stabilized at 49% in 2003. The report also noted that the tendency to be overweight and obese increases with age up to 64 years. BMI should be used cautiously for people aged 65 years and older, because the ""normal"" range may begin at slightly above 18.5 kg/m(2) and extend into the ""overweight"" range. The Chief Medical Officer of Health cautioned that these data may underestimate the true extent of the problem, because they were based on self reports, and people tend to over-report their height and under-report their weight. The actual number of Ontario adults who are overweight or obese may be higher. Diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. The goals of behavioural therapy are to identify, monitor, and alter behaviour that does not help weight loss. Techniques include self-monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, contingency management, and identifying and using social support. Relapse, when people resume old, unhealthy behaviour and then regain the weight, can be problematic. Drugs (including gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and appetite suppressants) may be used if behavioural interventions fail. However, estimates of efficacy may be confounded by high rates of noncompliance, in part owing to the side effects of the drugs. In addition, the drugs have not been approved for indefinite use, despite the chronic nature of obesity. THE TECHNOLOGY: Morbidly obese people may be eligible for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. There are various bariatric surgical procedures and several different variations for each of these procedures. The surgical interventions can be divided into 2 general types: malabsorptive (bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food), and restrictive (decreasing the size of the stomach so that the patient is satiated with less food). All of these may be performed as either open surgery or laparoscopically. An example of a malabsorptive technique is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Examples of restrictive techniques are vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services includes fee code ""S120 gastric bypass or partition, for morbid obesity"" as an insured service. The term gastric bypass is a general term that encompasses a variety of surgical methods, all of which involve reconfiguring the digestive system. The term gastric bypass does not include AGB. The number of gastric bypass procedures funded and done in Ontario, and funded as actual out-of-country approvals,() is shown below. Number of Gastric Bypass Procedures by Fiscal Year: Ontario and Actual Out-of-Country (OOC) ApprovalsData from Provider Services, MOHLTCCourtesy of Provider Services, Ministry of Health and Long Term Care REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to treat morbid obesity. It used its standard search strategy to retrieve international health technology assessments and English-language journal articles from selected databases. The interventions of interest were bariatric surgery and, for the controls, either optimal conventional management or another type of bariatric procedure. The outcomes of interest were improvement in comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension); short- and long-term weight loss; quality of life; adverse effects; and economic analysis data. The databases yielded 15 international health technology assessments or systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Subsequently, the Medical Advisory Secretariat searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from April 2004 to December 2004, after the search cut-off date of April, 2004, for the most recent systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. One of those 10 was the Swedish Obese Subjects study, which started as a registry and intervention study, and then published findings on people who had been enrolled for at least 2 years or at least 10 years. In addition to the literature review of economic analysis data, the Medical Advisory Secretariat also did an Ontario-based economic analysis. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions (including diabetes, high lipid levels, and hypertension). It also is effective at resolving the associated comorbid conditions. This conclusion is largely based on level 3a evidence from the prospectively designed Swedish Obese Subjects study, which recently published 10-year outcomes for patients who had bariatric surgery compared with patients who received nonsurgical treatment. (1)Regarding specific procedures, there is evidence that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques for weight loss and resolution of comorbid illnesses. However, there are no published prospective, long-term, direct comparisons of these techniques available.Surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. In the absence of direct comparisons of active nonsurgical intervention via caloric restriction with bariatric techniques, the following observations are made:A recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal, except for one trial on Weight Watchers. Furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years. (2)A recent randomized controlled trial reported 1-year outcomes comparing weight loss and metabolic changes in severely obese patients assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a conventional weight loss diet. At 1 year, weight loss was similar for patients in each group (mean, 2-5 kg). There was a favourable effect on triglyceride levels and glycemic control in the low-carbohydrate diet group. (3)A decision-analysis model showed bariatric surgery results in increased life expectancy in morbidly obese patients when compared to diet and exercise. (4)A cost-effectiveness model showed bariatric surgery is cost-effective relative to nonsurgical management. (5)Extrapolating from 2003 data from the United States, Ontario would likely need to do 3,500 bariatric surgeries per year. It currently does 508 per year, including out-of-country surgeries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Not SR | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design,Not addressing the prevalence of depression",,Bariatrics;Bariatric Surgery,,

CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Typically defined as a failure to conceive after a year of regular unprotected intercourse, infertility affects 8% to 16% of reproductive age couples. The condition can be caused by disruptions at various steps of the reproductive process. Major causes of infertility include abnormalities of sperm, tubal obstruction, endometriosis, ovulatory disorder, and idiopathic infertility. Depending on the cause and patient characteristics, management options range from pharmacologic treatment to more advanced techniques referred to as assisted reproductive technologies (ART). ART include IVF and IVF-related procedures such as intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and, according to some definitions, intra-uterine insemination (IUI), also known as artificial insemination. Almost invariably, an initial step in ART is controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), which leads to a significantly higher rate of multiple pregnancies after ART compared with that following natural conception. Multiple pregnancies are associated with a broad range of negative consequences for both mother and fetuses. Maternal complications include increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, gestational diabetes, fetal malpresentation requiring Caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage, and postpartum depression. Babies from multiple pregnancies are at a significantly higher risk of early death, prematurity, and low birth weight, as well as mental and physical disabilities related to prematurity. Increased maternal and fetal morbidity leads to higher perinatal and neonatal costs of multiple pregnancies, as well as subsequent lifelong costs due to disabilities and an increased need for medical and social support. THE TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: IVF was first developed as a method to overcome bilateral Fallopian tube obstruction. The procedure includes several steps: (1) the woman's egg is retrieved from the ovaries; (2) exposed to sperm outside the body and fertilized; (3) the embryo(s) is cultured for 3 to 5 days; and (4) is transferred back to the uterus. IFV is considered to be one of the most effective treatments for infertility today. According to data from the Canadian Assisted Reproductive Technology Registry, the average live birth rate after IVF in Canada is around 30%, but there is considerable variation in the age of the mother and primary cause of infertility. An important advantage of IVF is that it allows for the control of the number of embryos transferred. An elective single embryo transfer in IVF cycles adopted in many European countries was shown to significantly reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies while maintaining acceptable birth rates. However, when number of embryos transferred is not limited, the rate of IVF-associated multiple pregnancies is similar to that of other treatments involving ovarian stimulation. The practice of multiple embryo transfer in IVF is often the result of pressures to increase success rates due to the high costs of the procedure. The average rate of multiple pregnancies resulting from IVF in Canada is currently around 30%. An alternative to IVF is IUI. In spite of reported lower success rates of IUI (pregnancy rates per cycle range from 8.7% to 17.1%) it is generally attempted before IVF due to its lower invasiveness and cost. Two major drawbacks of IUI are that it cannot be used in cases of bilateral tubal obstruction and it does not allow much control over the risk of multiple pregnancies compared with IVF. The rate of multiple pregnancies after IUI with COS is estimated to be about 21% to 29%. Ontario Health Insurance Plan Coverage Currently, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan covers the cost of IVF for women with bilaterally blocked Fallopian tubes only, in which case it is funded for 3 cycles, excluding the cost of drugs. The cost of IUI is covered except for preparation of the sperm and drugs used for COS. DIFFUSION OF TECHNOLOGY: According to Canadian Assisted Reproductive Technology Registry data, in 2004 there were 25 infertility clinics across Canada offering IVF and 7,619 IVF cycles performed. In Ontario, there are 13 infertility clinics with about 4,300 IVF cycles performed annually. LITERATURE REVIEW: ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT ON REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES: The 1993 release of the Royal Commission report on reproductive technologies, Proceed With Care, resulted in the withdrawal of most IVF funding in Ontario, where prior to 1994 IVF was fully funded. Recommendations of the Commission to withdraw IVF funding were largely based on findings of the systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before 1990. The review showed IVF effectiveness only in cases of bilateral tubal obstruction. As for nontubal causes of infertility, there was not enough evidence to establish whether IVF was effective or not. Since the field of reproductive technology is constantly evolving, there have been several changes since the publication of the Royal Commission report. These changes include: increased success rates of IVF; introduction of ICSI in the early 1990's as a treatment for male factor infertility; and improved embryo implantation rates allowing for the transfer of a single embryo to avoid multiple pregnancies after IVF. STUDIES AFTER THE ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT: REVIEW STRATEGY THREE SEPARATE LITERATURE REVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: clinical effectiveness of IVF, cost-effectiveness of IVF, and outcomes of single embryo transfer (SET) in IVF cycles. CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF IVF: RCTs or meta-analyses of RCTs that compared live birth rates after IVF versus alternative treatments, where the cause of infertility was clearly stated or it was possible to stratify the outcome by the cause of infertility.COST EFFECTIVENESS OF IVF: All relevant economic studies comparing IVF to alternative methods of treatment were reviewedOUTCOMES OF IVF WITH SET: RCTs or meta-analyses of RCTs that compared live birth rates and multiple birth rates associated with transfer of single versus double embryos.OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment database, and websites of other health technology assessment agencies were searched using specific subject headings and keywords to identify relevant studies. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF IVF: Overall, there is a lack of well composed RCTs in this area and considerable diversity in both definition and measurement of outcomes exists between trials. Many studies used fertility or pregnancy rates instead of live birth rates. Moreover, the denominator for rate calculation varied from study to study (e.g. rates were calculated per cycle started, per cycle completed, per couple, etc...). Nevertheless, few studies of sufficient quality were identified and categorized by the cause of infertility and existing alternatives to IVF. The following are the key findings: A 2005 meta-analysis demonstrated that, in patients with idiopathic infertility, IVF was clearly superior to expectant management, but there were no statistically significant differences in live birth rates between IVF and IUI, nor between IVF and gamete-intra-Fallopian transfer.A subset of data from a 2000 study showed no significant differences in pregnancy rates between IVF and IUI for moderate male factor infertility.In patients with moderate male factor infertility, standard IVF was also compared with ICSI in a 2002 meta-analysis. All studies included in the meta-analysis showed superior fertilization rates with ICSI, and the pooled risk ratio for oocyte fertilization was 1.9 (95% Confidence Interval 1.4-2.5) in favour of ICSI. Two other RCTs in this area published after the 2002 meta-analysis had similar results and further confirmed these findings. There were no RCTs comparing IVF with ICSI in patients with severe male factor infertility, mainly because based on the expert opinion, ICSI might only be an effective treatment for severe male factor infertility. COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF IVF: Five economic evaluations of IVF were found, including one comprehensive systematic review of 57 health economic studies. The studies compared cost-effectiveness of IVF with a number of alternatives such as observation, ovarian stimulation, IUI, tubal surgery, varicocelectomy, etc... The cost-effectiveness of IVF was analyzed separately for different types of infertility. Most of the reviewed studies concluded that due to the high cost, IVF has a less favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared with alternative treatment options. Therefore, IVF was not recommended as the first line of treatment in the majority of cases. The only two exceptions were bilateral tubal obstruction and severe male factor infertility, where an immediate offer of IVF/ICSI might the most cost-effective option. CLINICAL OUTCOMES AFTER SINGLE VERSUS DOUBLE EMBRYO TRANSFER STRATEGIES OF IVF: Since the SET strategy has been more widely adopted in Europe, all RCT outcomes of SET were conducted in European countries. The major study in this area was a large 2005 meta-analysis, followed by two other published RCTs. All of these studies reached similar conclusions: Although a single SET cycle results in lower birth rates than a single double embryo transfer (DET) cycle, the cumulative birth rate after 2 cycles of SET (fresh + frozen-thawed embryos) was comparable to the birth rate after a single DET cycle (~40%).SET was associated with a significant reduction in multiple births compared with DET (0.8% vs. 33.1% respectively in the largest RCT).

PARTICIPANTS: A non-DHHS, nonadvocate 15-member panel representing the fields of geriatrics, nursing, gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, urology, general surgery, oncology, neurosurgery, epidemiology, biostatistics, psychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, environmental health sciences, and healthcare financing. In addition, 21 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience. EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience. CONFERENCE PROCESS: The panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was presented on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence will affect more than one fourth of all U.S. adults during their lives. The natural history of fecal incontinence is unknown, and the natural history of urinary incontinence over several years is not well described. (2) Fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence often have serious effects on the lives of the many individuals who suffer physical discomfort, embarrassment, stigma, and social isolation, and on family members, caregivers, and society. Financial costs are substantial and may be underestimated because of underreporting. (3) Routine episiotomy is the most easily preventable risk factor for fecal incontinence. Risk factors for both fecal and urinary incontinence include female sex, older age, and neurologic disease (including stroke). Increased body mass, decreased physical activity, depression, and diabetes may also increase risk. (4) Pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback are effective in preventing and reversing fecal and urinary incontinence in women for the first year after giving birth, and these approaches may also prevent or reduce urinary incontinence in older women and in men undergoing prostate surgery. Fecal and urinary incontinence may be prevented by lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise. (5) Efforts to raise public awareness of incontinence and the benefits of prevention and management should aim to eliminate stigma, promote disclosure and care-seeking, and reduce suffering. Organized approaches to improving clinical detection of fecal and urinary incontinence are needed and require rigorous evaluation. (6) To reduce the suffering and burden of fecal and urinary incontinence, research is needed to establish underlying mechanisms, describe a classification system, determine natural history, classify persons according to their future risk for fecal or urinary incontinence, design interventions targeted to specific population groups, determine the effects of these interventions, and guide public policy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population,wrong study design,Not addressing the prevalence of depression",,Adult;Cost of Illness;Fecal Incontinence/economics/*prevention & control/psychology;Female;Health Promotion;Humans;Life Style;Male;Quality of Life;Risk Factors;Urinary Incontinence/economics/*prevention & control/psychology;Urinary Incontinence,,

CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Obesity is defined as an excessive accumulation of body fat as measured by the body mass index (BMI) and calculated as body weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in metres squared (m(2)). People with a BMI over 30 kg/m(2) are considered obese in most countries. The condition is associated with the development of several diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes), hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon. Clinically severe, or morbid obesity, is commonly defined by a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2), or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m(2) if there are comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or arthritis. The prevalence of morbid obesity among people with type 2 diabetes has been examined and of 2,460 patients with type 2 diabetes, 52% (n = 1,279) were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and 23% (n = 561) had a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2). BARIATRIC SURGERY: Men and women with morbid obesity may be eligible for surgical intervention. There are numerous surgical options available, all of which can be divided into two general types, both of which can be performed either as open surgery or laparoscopically: malabsorptive - bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food, andrestrictive - decreasing the size of the stomach in order for the patient to feel satiated with a smaller amount foodSurgery for morbid obesity is usually considered a last resort for people who have attempted first-line medical management (e.g. diet, behaviour modification, increased physical activity, and drugs) but who have not lost weight permanently. Surgery is restricted to people with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) or those with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m(2) and serious comorbid conditions. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS METHODS: Details of the full literature search can be found in the 2005 evidence-based analysis of bariatric surgery (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/techmn.html). Briefly, a literature search was conducted examining published works from January 1996 to December 2004, including OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Data on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for the improvement of diabetesSystematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational controlled prospective studies that had >100 patientsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Duplicate publications (superseded by another publication by the same investigator group, with the same objective and data)Non-English-language articlesNon-systematic reviews, letters, and editorialsAnimal and in-vitro studiesCase reports, case seriesStudies that did not examine the outcomes of interest OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Improvement or resolution of diabetesThe quality of the studies was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria for grading quality of evidence. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: There is evidence that bariatric surgery is effective for improvement and resolution of diabetes in patients who are morbidly obese (BMI≥35 kg/m(2)). The quality of evidence for the use of bariatric surgery for the resolution or improvement of diabetes in morbidly obese people, according to the GRADE quality-of-evidence criteria, was found to be moderate (see ES Table 1). Comparison of various bariatric techniques: No prospective, long-term direct comparison is available between malabsorptive and restrictive techniques.Retrospective subgroup analyses from a large observational study showed greater improvement and resolution of diabetes using malabsorptive techniques rather than purely restrictive methods.There is evidence from a meta-analysis that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques in terms of improvement and resolution of diabetes.

The proposed model was defined as multidisciplinary, ambulatory, community-based care that bridged the gap between primary and tertiary care, and was intended for individuals with a chronic disease who were at risk of a hospital admission or emergency department visit. The goals of this care model were thought to include: the prevention of emergency department visits, a reduction in hospital admissions and re-admissions, facilitation of earlier hospital discharge, a reduction or delay in long-term care admissions, and an improvement in mortality and other disease-specific patient outcomes.OHTAC approved the development of an evidence-based assessment to determine the effectiveness of specialized community based care for the management of heart failure, Type 2 diabetes and chronic wounds.PLEASE VISIT THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT WEB SITE AT: www.health.gov.on.ca/ohtas to review the following reports associated with the Specialized Multidisciplinary Community-Based care series.Specialized multidisciplinary community-based care series: a summary of evidence-based analysesCommunity-based care for the specialized management of heart failure: an evidence-based analysisCommunity-based care for chronic wound management: an evidence-based analysisPlease note that the evidence-based analysis of specialized community-based care for the management of diabetes titled: ""Community-based care for the management of type 2 diabetes: an evidence-based analysis"" has been published as part of the Diabetes Strategy Evidence Platform at this URL: http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/ohtas/tech_diabetes_20091020.htmlPLEASE VISIT THE TORONTO HEALTH ECONOMICS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT COLLABORATIVE WEB SITE AT: http://theta.utoronto.ca/papers/MAS_CHF_Clinics_Report.pdf to review the following economic project associated with this series:Community-based Care for the specialized management of heart failure: a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this evidence-based review is to determine the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary wound care team for the management of chronic wounds. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Chronic wounds develop from various aetiologies including pressure, diabetes, venous pathology, and surgery. A pressure ulcer is defined as a localized injury to the skin/and or underlying tissue occurring most often over a bony prominence and caused, alone or in combination, by pressure, shear, or friction. Up to three fifths of venous leg ulcers are due to venous aetiology. Approximately 1.5 million Ontarians will sustain a pressure ulcer, 111,000 will develop a diabetic foot ulcer, and between 80,000 and 130,000 will develop a venous leg ulcer. Up to 65% of those afflicted by chronic leg ulcers report experiencing decreased quality of life, restricted mobility, anxiety, depression, and/or severe or continuous pain. MULTIDISCIPLINARY WOUND CARE TEAMS: The term 'multidisciplinary' refers to multiple disciplines on a team and 'interdisciplinary' to such a team functioning in a coordinated and collaborative manner. There is general consensus that a group of multidisciplinary professionals is necessary for optimum specialist management of chronic wounds stemming from all aetiologies. However, there is little evidence to guide the decision of which professionals might be needed form an optimal wound care team. LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on July 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, OVID EMBASE, Wiley Cochrane, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/International Agency for Health Technology Assessment, and on July 13, 2009 using the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies pertaining to leg and foot ulcers. A similar literature search was conducted on July 29' 2009 for studies pertaining to pressure ulcers. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained.

There was variation in the setting, composition of the wound care team, outcome measures, and follow up periods between the studies. In both studies, however, the wound care team members received training in wound care management and followed a wound care management protocol. In the RCT, Vu et al. reported a non-significant difference between the proportion of wounds healed in 6 months using a univariate analysis (61.7% for treatment vs. 52.5% for control; p=0.074, RR=1.19) There was also a non-significant difference in the mean time to healing in days (82 for treatment vs. 101 for control; p=0.095). More persons in the intervention group had a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score equal to zero (better pain control) at 6 months when compared with the control group (38.6% for intervention vs. 24.4% for control; p=0.017, RR=1.58). By multivariate analysis a statistically significant hazard ratio was reported in the intervention group (1.73, 95% CI 1.20-1.50; p=0.003). In the CCT, Harrison et al. reported a statistically significant difference in healing rates between the pre (control) and post (intervention) phases of the study. Of patients in the pre phase, 23% had healed ulcers 3 months after study enrolment, whereas 56% were healed in the post phase (P<0.001, OR=4.17) (Figure 3). Furthermore, 27% of patients were treated daily or more often in the pre phase whereas only 6% were treated at this frequency in the post phase (P<0.001), equal to a 34% relative risk reduction in frequency of daily treatments. The authors did not report the results of pain relief assessment. The body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology for 4 outcomes: proportion of wounds healed, proportion of persons with healed wounds, wound associated pain relief, and proportion of persons needing daily wound treatments. In general, the evidence was found to be low to very low quality. CONCLUSION: The evidence supports that managing chronic wounds with a multidisciplinary wound care team significantly increases wound healing and reduces the severity of wound-associated pain and the required daily wound treatments compared to persons not managed by a wound care team. The quality of evidence supporting these outcomes is low to very low meaning that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design,Not describing diabetes as a whole",,"",,

The clinical utility was based on the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on outcomes specific to each of these conditions. The prevalence of celiac disease in asymptomatic individuals and one of these non-gastrointestinal conditions was also evaluated. CLINICAL NEED AND TARGET POPULATION: CELIAC DISEASE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory state of the proximal small bowel mucosa accompanied by structural and functional changes. TECHNOLOGY UNDER EVALUATION: SEROLOGIC TESTS FOR CELIAC DISEASE: There are a number of serologic tests for celiac disease available. Serologic tests are automated with the exception of the anti-endomysial antibody test, which is more time-consuming and operator-dependent than the other tests. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated?What is the effect of the gluten-free diet on condition-specific outcomes in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated?What is the clinical utility of serologic testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic patients presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated? The clinical utility was defined as the impact of the GFD on disease specific outcomes.What is the risk of all-cause mortality and lymphoma in individuals with asymptomatic celiac disease?What is the budget impact of serologic testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic subjects presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated? STUDY POPULATION: The study population consisted of individuals with newly diagnosed celiac disease without any symptoms consistent with the disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. When evaluating the risk of lymphoma and all-cause mortality, the study population consisted of asymptomatic individuals with a positive celiac disease serologic test and/or small bowel biopsy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature searches were performed for each disease/condition evaluated between December 2010 and March 2011 using OVID MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). No restrictions for start date of search were used. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that assessed the effects of a GFD in patients with newly diagnosed asymptomatic celiac disease presenting with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. If symptoms were not reported in the study but subjects were identified through screening for celiac disease the study was included.Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that assessed the prevalence of newly diagnosed asymptomatic celiac disease in patients with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated. If symptoms were not reported in the study but subjects were identified through screening for celiac disease the study was included.Studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that evaluated the risk of all-cause mortality or lymphoma in individuals with asymptomatic celiac disease.Sample size ≥ 10.Publications in English. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that retrospectively assessed the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease.Studies that reported the prevalence of one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated in subjects already diagnosed with celiac disease.Studies in individuals with one of the non-gastrointestinal conditions evaluated if the condition could be explained by other causes.Studies in subjects with celiac disease and symptoms consistent with the disease. If the study included individuals with and without symptoms consistent with celiac disease and their results were analysed separately, the results in individuals without symptoms were included in the analysis.Studies in which individuals did not report any symptoms consistent with celiac disease at study start but that either retrospectively reported the presence of such symptoms after following a GFD, or that previously presented with symptoms consistent with celiac disease.Study results published in letters to the editor or comments about other studies.Studies with a sample size ≥ 10, however, in which less than 10 patients were included in the analysis. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The effects of a GFD on disease-specific outcomes for each condition evaluated in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease was assessed. The prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients presenting with one of the conditions evaluated was also assessed. RESULTS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: Three eligible observational studies evaluated the effects of GFD on growth parameters in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature. Four eligible observational studies evaluated the effects of GFD on metabolic control in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. Five eligible observational studies evaluated the risk of all-cause mortality and five eligible observational studies evaluated the risk of lymphoma in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease. No eligible studies on the effects of the GFD for the other conditions evaluated were identified. Twenty-three eligible studies measured the prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in subjects presenting with one of the conditions evaluated. PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS: The prevalence of celiac disease in asymptomatic patients presenting with one of the conditions evaluated was analysed. Most studies also included a control group that generally consisted of individuals randomly selected from the general population. Although there was a trend to a higher prevalence of asymptomatic celiac disease in individuals with the conditions evaluated compared to the controls, it only reached statistical significance in type 1 diabetes. No eligible prevalence studies were identified in patients with amenorrhea, delayed puberty, alopecia, and depression. THE EFFECTS OF A GLUTEN-FREE DIET ON DISEASE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: THE EFFECTS OF GFD ON METABOLIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE AND TYPE 1 DIABETES: The effects of a GFD on metabolic control (HbA1c, number of hypoglycemic episodes, and changes in insulin dosage) in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and type 1 diabetes were evaluated. One prospective case-control study reported an increase in HbA1c levels in cases with type 1 diabetes and asymptomatic celiac disease after the introduction of a GFD, however, the clinical significance of this change is unclear. Only one eligible retrospective case-control study evaluated the effects of a GFD on hypoglycemia episodes and since there were inadequate details in the study about both the ascertainment and severity of hypoglycemia episodes in both cases and controls, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the effects of a GFD on hypoglycemia episodes based on this study. One prospective case-control study did not show a statistically significant change in insulin dosage between cases with type 1 diabetes and asymptomatic celiac disease and controls with type 1 diabetes either before or after the introduction of a GFD. No eligible studies that evaluated the effects of a GFD on the long-term outcomes of type 1 diabetes such as cardiovascular or renal events in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease were identified. THE EFFECTS OF A GLUTEN-FREE DIET IN PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE AND ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: A total of 3 eligible studies were identified. All studies consisted of case series that compared growth parameters in subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature before and after the celiac disease was diagnosed and the GFD was instituted. Most subjects included in the studies demonstrated an improvement in growth parameters. Compliance with the GFD was not reported in the studies. The results of the studies suggest an increase in growth velocity in pediatric patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and idiopathic short stature once a GFD is introduced. RISK OF LYMPHOMA IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE: One retrospective cohort study evaluated the risk of lymphoma in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease. The authors concluded that the number of events identified was low during the long follow-up period and that the risk of overall malignancies was not increased among patients with asymptomatic celiac disease. RISK OF ASYMPTOMATIC CELIAC DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA: Four case-control studies, one of which retrospective, evaluated the risk of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients newly diagnosed with lymphoma. One retrospective cohort study did not show an increase in the risk of lymphoma among subjects with asymptomatic celiac disease. Three prospective case-control studies did not find a statistically significant risk of asymptomatic celiac disease in patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma.

In Canada, the 1-year prevalence of major depressive disorder was approximately 6% in Canadians 18 and older. A large prospective Canadian study reported an increased risk of developing depression in people with chronic diseases compared with those without such diseases. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature regarding the effectiveness of screening for depression and/or anxiety in adults with chronic diseases in the community setting. To conduct a non-systematic, post-hoc analysis to evaluate whether a screen-and-treat strategy for depression is associated with an improvement in chronic disease outcomes. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed on January 29, 2012, using OVID MEDLINE, OVID MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, OVID EMBASE, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Wiley Cochrane Library, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, for studies published from January 1, 2002 until January 29, 2012. REVIEW METHODS: No citations were identified for the first objective. For the second, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials that compared depression management for adults with chronic disease with usual care/placebo were included. Where possible, the results of randomized controlled trials were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight primary randomized controlled trials and 1 systematic review were included in the post-hoc analysis (objective 2)-1 in people with diabetes, 2 in people with heart failure, and 5 in people with coronary artery disease. Across all studies, there was no evidence that managing depression improved chronic disease outcomes. The quality of evidence (GRADE) ranged from low to moderate. Some of the study results (specifically in coronary artery disease populations) were suggestive of benefit, but the differences were not significant. LIMITATIONS: The included studies varied in duration of treatment and follow-up, as well as in included forms of depression. In most of the trials, the authors noted a significant placebo response rate that could be attributed to spontaneous resolution of depression or mild disease. In some studies, placebo groups may have had access to care as a result of screening, since it would be unethical to withhold all care. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to suggest that a screen-and-treat strategy for depression among adults with chronic diseases resulted in improved chronic disease outcomes. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: People with chronic diseases are more likely to have depression than people without chronic diseases. This is a problem because depression may make the chronic disease worse or affect how a person manages it. Discovering depression earlier may make it easier for people to cope with their condition, leading to better health and quality of life. We reviewed studies that looked at screening and treating for depression in people with chronic diseases. In people with diabetes, treatment of depression did not affect clinical measures of diabetes management. In people with heart failure and coronary artery disease, treatment of depression did not improve heart failure management or reduce rates of heart attacks or death. At present, there is no evidence that screening and treating for depression improves the symptoms of chronic diseases or lead to use of fewer health care services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",,Adult;Canada/epidemiology;Chronic Disease/*psychology;Coronary Artery Disease/psychology;Depression/*diagnosis/*therapy;Diabetes Mellitus/psychology;Heart Failure/psychology;Humans;Mass Screening/methods/*standards;Myocardial Infarction/psychology;Ontario/epidemiology;Chronic Disease;Mass Screening,,

Meta-analytic evidence in obstructive sleep apnoea"" by Shenooka Nanthakumar, Romola S. Bucks and Timothy C. Skinner (Health Psychology, 2016[May], Vol 35[5], 423-432). In the article, “Cognitive items” should read “Cognition items” in column 1, line 7 of Table 2. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-49649-001.) INTRODUCTION: Depression is common in chronic illness, albeit prevalence can be highly variable. This variability may be a function of symptom overlap between depression and chronic illness. Using Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) as an exemplar, this meta-analysis explored whether the proportion of overlapping symptoms between OSA and depression, within different depression questionnaires, moderates prevalence estimates. METHODS: A systematic search identified 13 studies meeting eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Based on depression questionnaires, the prevalence of depression in OSA ranged from 8% to 68%, reflecting marked heterogeneity. Prevalence estimates based on questionnaires with greater symptom overlap between OSA and depression were higher, whereas questionnaires with a higher proportion of anhedonia symptoms were associated with lower prevalence estimates. DISCUSSION: Overall, these data suggest that when using depression questionnaires to assess the prevalence of depression in OSA, questionnaires that have a lower proportion of symptom overlap between OSA and depression, as well as a higher proportion of anhedonia symptoms, reduce the likelihood of overestimating the prevalence of depression in OSA. This study has implications for other chronic illnesses with symptom overlap with depression, for example diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart disease, as well as suggesting that depression questionnaires are not equally appropriate for assessing depression symptomatology in chronic illness populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population,Not describing diabetes as a whole",10.1037/hea0000394,Questionnaires;Chronic Disease;Prevalence;Sleep,,

More recently, it has been used in patient populations with cardiac disease and, in particular, in those patients with heart failure. The benefits of testosterone supplementation have been demonstrated in the literature, but there is also concern that testosterone supplementation may not be benign, especially when administered to achieve supraphysiological levels, e.g., to improve athletic performance. Areas covered: This review seeks to address the link between testosterone levels and cardiac disease while discussing the safety concerns of testosterone supplementation in clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that were obtained through a literature search of the Medline database are discussed in this paper. Expert opinion: Ultimately, the definitive role of testosterone in cardiovascular disease remains contentious, but testosterone may have niche roles in certain conditions, such as advanced heart failure and cardiac cachexia. Testosterone has been used safely, and we believe may continue to be used safely, in men with cardiac disease when achieving physiological levels, with adequate monitoring of prostate specific antigen and hematocrit levels during the course of treatment per established clinical guidelines. Testosterone might exert beneficial effects on physical capacity and functioning as well as overall outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population,wrong study design",10.1517/14740338.2011.566213,high density lipoprotein;prostate specific antigen;testosterone;testosterone cipionate;testosterone undecanoate;tumor necrosis factor;angiocardiography;cachexia;cancer incidence;cardiac patient;cardiovascular risk;clinical practice;coronary artery disease;double blind procedure;drug safety;dyslipidemia;heart failure;hematocrit;hormonal therapy;hormone substitution;human;hypertension;lipoprotein blood level;Medline;meta analysis;mortality;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;nonhuman;physical capacity;prostate cancer;randomized controlled trial (topic);review;ST segment depression;systematic review;testosterone blood level;Testosterone,,

E. and Newlove‐Delgado, T. V. and Bethel, A. and Thompson‐Coon, J. and Whear, R. and Logan, S.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010971.pub2,,,,"- Background This review supersedes the original Cochrane review first published in 2008 (Huertas‐Ceballos 2008). Between 4% and 25% of school‐aged children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. No organic cause for this pain can be found on physical examination or investigation for the majority of such children. Although many children are managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of psychosocial interventions involving cognitive and behavioural components have been recommended. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing pain in school‐aged children with RAP. Search methods In June 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers. We also searched the references of identified studies and relevant reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial therapies with usual care, active control, or wait‐list control for children and adolescents (aged 5 to 18 years) with RAP or an abdominal pain‐related functional gastrointestinal disorder defined by the Rome III criteria were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Five review authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. We also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results This review includes 18 randomised controlled trials (14 new to this version), reported in 26 papers, involving 928 children and adolescents with RAP between the ages of 6 and 18 years. The interventions were classified into four types of psychosocial therapy: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy (including guided imagery), yoga, and written self‐disclosure. The studies were carried out in the USA, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Brazil. The majority of the studies were small and short term; only two studies included more than 100 participants, and only five studies had follow‐up assessments beyond six months. Small sample sizes and the degree of assessed risk of performance and detection bias in many studies led to the overall quality of the evidence being rated as low to very low for all outcomes. For CBT compared to control, we found evidence of treatment success postintervention (odds ratio (OR) 5.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 27.32; Z = 2.16; P = 0.03; 4 studies; 175 children; very low‐quality evidence), but no evidence of treatment success at medium‐term follow‐up (OR 3.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 10.16; Z = 1.85; P = 0.06; 3 studies; 139 children; low‐quality evidence) or long‐term follow‐up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.33; Z = 0.53; P = 0.60; 2 studies; 120 children; low‐quality evidence). We found no evidence of effects of intervention on pain intensity scores measured postintervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.74 to 0.08; 7 studies; 405 children; low‐quality evidence), or at medium‐term follow‐up (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.85 to 0.20; 4 studies; 301 children; low‐quality evidence). For hypnotherapy (including studies of guided imagery) compared to control, we found evidence of greater treatment success postintervention (OR 6.78, 95% CI 2.41 to 19.07; Z = 3.63; P = 0.0003; 4 studies; 146 children; low‐quality evidence) as well as reductions in pain intensity (SMD ‐1.01, 95% CI ‐1.41 to ‐0.61; Z = 4.97; P < 0.00001; 4 studies; 146 children; low‐quality evidence) and pain frequency (SMD ‐1.28, 95% CI ‐1.84 to ‐0.72; Z = 4.48; P < 0.00001; 4 studies; 146 children; low‐quality evidence). The only study of long‐term effect reported continued benefit of hypnotherapy compared to usual care after five years, with 68% reporting treatment success compared to 20% of controls (P = 0.005). For yoga therapy compared to control, we found no evidence of effectiveness on pain intensity reduction postintervention (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.6 to 0.05; Z = 1.69; P = 0.09; 3 studies; 122 children; low‐quality evidence). The single study of written self‐disclosure therapy reported no benefit for pain. There was no evidence of effect from the pooled analyses for any type of intervention on the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, and quality of daily life. There were no adverse effects for any of the interventions reported. Authors' conclusions The data from trials to date provide some evidence for beneficial effects of CBT and hypnotherapy in reducing pain in the short term in children and adolescents presenting with RAP. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of yoga therapy or written self‐disclosure therapy. There were insufficient data to explore effects of treatment by RAP subtype. Higher‐quality, longer‐duration trials are needed to fully investigate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions. Identifying the active components of the interventions and establishing whether benefits are sustained in the long term are areas of priority. Future research studies would benefit from employing active control groups to help minimise potential bias from wait‐list control designs and to help account for therapist and intervention time.

Background Between 4% and 25% of school‐aged children complain of recurrent abdominal pain severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. No organic cause for this pain can be found on physical examination or investigation for the majority of such children. Although many children are managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of psychological and behavioural ('psychosocial') therapies have been recommended. Methods and study characteristics As of June 2016, we identified 18 randomised controlled trials (a type of scientific experiment in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatments), which included 928 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 18 years. These studies compared a range of psychosocial therapy to usual care or some form of non‐therapy control (such as education or breathing exercises). We identified four different kinds of psychosocial therapy: cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy, yoga, and written self‐disclosure (a therapy that involves writing down thoughts and feelings about something distressing). The duration of the included studies ranged from five days to three months. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Brazil. Key results We found that cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy may be effective in terms of reducing pain in the short term. There was little evidence of long‐term benefit. There was no evidence that either therapy had a beneficial effect on quality of life, daily activities, or psychological outcomes such as anxiety and depression. Yoga therapy and written self‐disclosure as a therapy had no effect on pain, quality of life, or daily activities. No adverse effects were reported from any of these therapies. Quality of the evidence We rated the overall quality of the evidence as low to very low for all outcomes. Many of the studies had small sample sizes or weaknesses in their study design. The authors reported no conflicts of interest in relation to funding. Conclusion Cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy warrant consideration by clinicians as part of the management strategy for children with recurrent abdominal pain. The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low. More high‐quality research is needed to evaluate the particular aspects of the therapies that are effective and to establish whether benefits are maintained over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD010971.pub2,"*Self Disclosure;*Yoga;Abdominal Pain [*therapy];Adolescent;Child;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [methods];Humans;Hypnosis [*methods];Imagery, Psychotherapy;Psychotherapy [*methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recurrence;Abdominal Pain",,

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, British Nursing Index, Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Central, Social Sciences Citation Index, Social Policy and Practice, and HMIC from inception to January 2013. Review methods: Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two reviewers. Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Nine articles (from eight original randomised controlled trials)met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. In total, 578 participants were enrolled across the trials, with participants presenting with prehypertension/hypertension (n = 3 trials), type 1 or 2 diabetes (n = 2), heart disease (n = 2) and stroke (n = 1). Meta-analyses, using standardised mean differences, showed evidence of reductions in stress (−0.36; 95% CI−0.67 to−0.09; p= 0.01), depression (−0.35; 95% CI−0.53 to−0.16; p= 0.003) and anxiety (−0.50; 95% CI −0.70 to −0.29; p b 0.001). Effects on physical outcomes (blood pressure, albuminuria, stress hormones) were mixed. Conclusion: Whilst populations with vascular disease appear to derive a range of psychological benefits from MBSR/MBCT intervention, the effects on physical parameters of disease are not yet established. More robust studies, with longer term follow-up, are required to ascertain full effectiveness of such intervention.

Diabetic patients usually have more extensive and more severe atherosclerotic disease. PTCA in diabetic patients is associated with high success and low complication rates, a finding which is also confirmed by our own study. Although long term survival is acceptable, diabetic patients may also have a higher rate of infarction and a greater need for additional revascularization procedures, probably because of early restenosis and late progression of coronary artery disease. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with progression of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing bypass surgery. The relative merits of PTCA compared to bypass surgery is still not clear. However, a recent report (The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation - BARI) indicated that 5-year survival was better after initial treatment with bypass surgery than PTCA. The benefits of newer devices, particularly primary coronary stent implantation, are still being investigated in several studies. At present, the choice of management strategy is still undetermined and personal preference will play an important part in the decision process. However, medical therapy, with intensive risk factor and lifestyle modification, should never be dismissed. This report describes clinical experience with PTCA in the diabetic population in Jakarta. The data were derived from 1000 PTCA patients of whom 131 were diabetics. Angiographic success was achieved in 316 of 342 lesions (92.4%) and procedural success in 118 of 131 patients (90.1%). One patient underwent emergency coronary bypass surgery, two developed myocardial infarction and none died. Our experience showed that PTCA in the diabetics is associated with high success and low major adverse cardiac event rates. The prevalence of restenosis was unknown since the majority of the patients did not undergo repeat cardiac catheterization for angiographic follow up.","trapidil | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.13181/mji.v6i3.821,advanced glycation end product;anticoagulant agent;antiinflammatory agent;endothelin 1;fibroblast growth factor 2;heparan sulfate;platelet derived growth factor;somatomedin C;transforming growth factor beta antibody;acute heart infarction;adult;aged;angiocardiography;angiogenic gene therapy;article;cardiovascular risk;carotid atherosclerosis;coronary atherosclerosis;coronary artery bypass surgery;coronary artery disease;coronary artery recanalization;coronary stent;diabetes mellitus;dyslipidemia;electrocardiography;female;heart catheterization;human;hyperinsulinemia;Indonesia;major clinical study;male;meta analysis (topic);percutaneous coronary intervention;randomized controlled trial (topic);restenosis;smoking;ST segment depression;transluminal coronary angioplasty;trapidil,,

A. and Rathbone, J. and Thornley, B. and Soares‐Weiser, K.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000284.pub3,,,,"- Background Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non‐affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed‐effect model. Main results We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow‐up (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n=1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n=942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n=1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43). Authors' conclusions The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well‐established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence‐based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia For previous plain language summary please see Appendix 3 . People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, being an older drug (‘typical’ or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in reating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD000284.pub3,"Antipsychotic Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use];Chlorpromazine [adverse effects, *therapeutic use];Humans;Placebo Effect;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia [*drug therapy, prevention & control];Secondary Prevention;Schizophrenia;Chlorpromazine",,

METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from inception to August 2005 and included English-language articles that enrolled adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and (1) contained intervention(s) with CCM component(s), (2) included a comparison group or measures at 2 points (before/after), and (3) had relevant outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data. RESULTS: Symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and functional status were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. However, pooled relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for emergency/unscheduled visits and hospitalizations for the group that received at least 2 CCM components were 0.58 (0.42-0.79) and 0.78 (0.66-0.94), respectively. The weighted mean difference (95% confidence interval) for hospital stay was -2.51 (-3.40 to -1.61) days shorter for the group that received 2 or more components. There were no significant differences for those receiving only 1 CCM component. CONCLUSIONS: Limited published data exist evaluating the efficacy of CCM components in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management. However, pooled data demonstrated that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received interventions with 2 or more CCM components had lower rates of hospitalizations and emergency/unscheduled visits and a shorter length of stay compared with control groups. The results of this review highlight the need for well-designed trials in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1001/archinte.167.6.551,"*Disease Management;Dyspnea/therapy;Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data;Exercise Test;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/mortality/*therapy;Quality Assurance, Health Care;Quality of Life;Research Design;Respiratory Function Tests;Lung Diseases, Obstructive;Lung Diseases",,

A comprehensive two-decade literature review (1989-2009) from peer-reviewed journals was undertaken to examine the roles if any, of therapeutic exercise as an intervention for sexual dysfunction in patients with diabetes. Because of the paucity of studies on this subject, meta-analyses, small and non-randomized trials cited on Medline, Pedro, Embase, Scirus, Highwire and the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews were examined. Sexual dysfunction in general, links between diabetes and sexual dysfunction and management options for sexual dysfunction including therapeutic exercises were reviewed. In women, diabetes is reported to slightly increase the risk of decreased sexual arousal, inadequate lubrication and pain on sexual intercourse, while erectile dysfunction is the most common presentation of sexual dysfunction in men. The literature is scanty but shows some effectiveness of therapeutic exercise in managing sexual dysfunction in patients with diabetes. However, this review shows that i) pelvic floor exercises ii) biofeedback techniques iii) electrical stimulation and iv) vaginal dilators are effective in managing sexual dysfunction secondary to other disease factors in the non-diabetic populations. More research is recommended to further establish the efficacy of therapeutic exercises in managing sexual dysfunction in patients with diabetes. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","delatestryl     depo testosterone | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong publication type",10.2174/157339910791658907,phosphodiesterase V inhibitor;sildenafil;tadalafil;testosterone;testosterone cipionate;testosterone enantate;testosterone ester;article;clinical effectiveness;diabetes mellitus;dyspareunia;ejaculation disorder;electrostimulation;erectile dysfunction;feedback system;female sexual dysfunction;human;hypogonadism;kinesiotherapy;lubrication;male sexual dysfunction;orgasm disorder;pelvic floor muscle training;priority journal;psychotherapy;sexual arousal disorder;sexual dysfunction;therapy effect;vaginism;delatestryl;depo testosterone,,

In this study, the genetics of syncope were investigated to seek knowledge about its pathophysiology and prognostic implications. METHODS AND RESULTS: This genome-wide association meta-analysis included 56 071 syncope cases and 890 790 controls from deCODE genetics (Iceland), UK Biobank (United Kingdom), and Copenhagen Hospital Biobank Cardiovascular Study/Danish Blood Donor Study (Denmark), with a follow-up assessment of variants in 22 412 cases and 286 003 controls from Intermountain (Utah, USA) and FinnGen (Finland). The study yielded 18 independent syncope variants, 17 of which were novel. One of the variants, p.Ser140Thr in PTPRN2, affected syncope only when maternally inherited. Another variant associated with a vasovagal reaction during blood donation and five others with heart rate and/or blood pressure regulation, with variable directions of effects. None of the 18 associations could be attributed to cardiovascular or other disorders. Annotation with regard to regulatory elements indicated that the syncope variants were preferentially located in neural-specific regulatory regions. Mendelian randomization analysis supported a causal effect of coronary artery disease on syncope. A polygenic score (PGS) for syncope captured genetic correlation with cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and shortened lifespan. However, a score based solely on the 18 syncope variants performed similarly to the PGS in detecting syncope risk but did not associate with other disorders. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that syncope has a distinct genetic architecture that implicates neural regulatory processes and a complex relationship with heart rate and blood pressure regulation. A shared genetic background with poor cardiovascular health was observed, supporting the importance of a thorough assessment of individuals presenting with syncope.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1093/eurheartj/ehad016,"Humans;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Syncope/genetics;*Cardiovascular Diseases/genetics;Autonomic Nervous System;*Diabetes Mellitus;Mendelian Randomization Analysis;Ptprn2;Gwas;Imprinting;Meta-analysis;Syncope;Vasovagal reaction;genetics/Amgen, Inc.: Hildur M Aegisdottir, Rosa B Thorolfsdottir, Gardar;Sveinbjornsson, Olafur A Stefansson, Bjarni Gunnarsson, Vinicius Tragante, Lilja;Stefansdottir, Thorgeir E Thorgeirsson, Egil Ferkingstad, Gudmar Thorleifsson,;Michael L Frigge, Kristjan E Hjorleifsson, Erna V Ivarsdottir, Anna Helgadottir,;Solveig Gretarsdottir, Valgerdur Steinthorsdottir, Asmundur Oddsson, Hannes P;Eggertsson, Gisli H Halldorsson, Patrick Sulem, Gudmundur Norddahl, Gudrun;Rutsdottir, Gudmundur Thorgeirsson, David O Arnar, Unnur Thorsteinsdottir, Daniel;F Gudbjartsson, Hilma Holm, and Kari Stefansson.

Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (30‐day prevalence of at least one occasion of 60 g of pure alcohol intake among current drinkers) is estimated at 20% and the prevalence of AUD at 5% of the adult general population, with highest prevalence in Europe and North America. Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating people with AUD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of baclofen on achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption in people with AUD compared to placebo, no treatment or any other pharmacological relapse prevention treatment. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 22 November 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for AUD treatment with placebo, no treatment or other treatments. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. relapse, 2. frequency of use, 3. amount of use, 4. adverse events, 5. dropouts from treatment and 6. dropouts from treatment due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 7. craving, 8. anxiety, 9. depression and 10. frequency of most relevant adverse events. Main results We included 17 RCTs (1818 participants) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition or International Classification of Diseases 10th edition criteria. Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments. We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias. Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg). Compared to placebo, moderate‐certainty evidence found that baclofen probably decreases the risk to relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.99; 12 studies, 1057 participants). This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants. High‐certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants). This result was confirmed among all subgroups of participants except non‐detoxified or those who received medium doses. There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.18, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD −0.45, 95% CI −1.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high‐certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulte lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD −0.16, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants). Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events. Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low‐certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI −11.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated. Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low‐certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI −3.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated. Authors' conclusions Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study. Plain language summary Baclofen for alcohol use disorder Key messages of the review We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of baclofen for treating people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in order to achieve and maintain abstinence (stopping drinking) or reduce alcohol consumption. Current evidence suggests that it may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence, particularly in people who are already detoxified. The results of comparisons with other medications were mainly based on a single study and do not allow us to draw conclusions. Review topics and aims AUD is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders, leading to specific physical, mood, learning and memory problems, and consequences for overall well‐being and health. The misuse of alcohol is one of the biggest risks to health worldwide, causing 20% to 30% of oesophageal (food pipe) cancer, liver disease, epilepsy (fits), motor vehicle accidents, murders and other intentional injuries. For many years, the main treatments for AUD have been psychosocial strategies (helping people to recognise that they need help), but using only psychosocial treatments has limited success. A high proportion of people with AUD do not respond to treatment at all, and those who do respond do not stay alcohol‐free in the long‐term. Medications such as baclofen could play an important role in treating people with AUD. Review methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments or control groups) evaluating the effect of baclofen in reducing alcohol consumption or in achieving and maintaining abstinence (or both) when compared to placebo (inac ive medication) or other medications. We pooled similar studies and evaluated the effects dividing the studies according to the doses of baclofen, duration of treatment, and alcohol consumption and the beginning of treatment (i.e. into detoxified or non‐detoxified participants on the basis if they were abstinent or were still drinking at the beginning of treatment). Summary of results We found 17 studies with 1818 participants with AUD. The duration of the interventions ranged from three months to one year. Five studies were in the USA; two each in Australia, France, India and Italy; and one each in Germany, Israel and the Netherlands. Doses of baclofen were 30 mg a day to 300 mg a day, and, in some cases, the doses were increased during the treatment. Seventeen studies compared baclofen to placebo (dummy medication), two compared baclofen to acamprosate (medication used to treat AUD), and two compared baclofen to naltrexone (medication used to treat AUD). Compared with placebo, baclofen probably helps people with AUD at reducing the risk of relapse and increasing the rate of abstinent days. These effects may be more evident among detoxified than non‐detoxified people with AUD. Baclofen probably makes no difference in the rate of heavy drinking days; drinks per drinking days; craving, anxiety and depression severity; number of participants who dropout from treatment for any reason; those who dropped out due to adverse events (side effects); or the number of participants with at least one adverse event. Baclofen may increase adverse events such as fatigue, vertigo (a feeling that everything is spinning), sleepiness, dry mouth, numbness and muscle spasm but we found no differences between baclofen and placebo for other adverse events. Certainty of evidence  The certainty of evidence (how much we can be confident that the evidence is reliable) was high for results about the percentage of days of abstinence, the number of participants with at least one adverse event, people dropping out of the studies for any reason, and people dropping out due to adverse events. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for results about returning to any drinking, heavy drinking days and number of drinks per drinking days. Search date  The evidence is current to November 2021.

P.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008581.pub2,,,,"- Background Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem characterized by recidivism, and medical and psychosocial complications. The co‐occurrence of major depression in people entering treatment for alcohol dependence is common, and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, which negatively influences treatment outcomes. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of antidepressants for the treatment of people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (via CRSLive), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to July 2017. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ). All searches included non‐English language literature. We handsearched references of topic‐related systematic reviews and the included studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing antidepressants alone or in association with other drugs or psychosocial interventions (or both) versus placebo, no treatment, and other pharmacological or psychosocial interventions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 33 studies in the review (2242 participants). Antidepressants were compared to placebo (22 studies), psychotherapy (two studies), other medications (four studies), or other antidepressants (five studies). The mean duration of the trials was 9.9 weeks (range 3 to 26 weeks). Eighteen studies took place in the USA, 12 in Europe, two in Turkey, and one in Australia. The antidepressant included in most of the trials was sertraline; other medications were amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, mianserin, mirtazepine, nefazodone, paroxetine, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and viloxazine. Eighteen studies were conducted in an outpatient setting, nine in an inpatient setting, and six in both settings. Psychosocial treatment was provided in 18 studies. There was high heterogeneity in the selection of outcomes and the rating systems used for diagnosis and outcome assessment. Comparing antidepressants to placebo, low‐quality evidence suggested that antidepressants reduced the severity of depression evaluated with interviewer‐rated scales at the end of trial (14 studies, 1074 participants, standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.49 to ‐0.04). However, the difference became non‐significant after the exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias (SMD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.04). In addition, very low‐quality evidence supported the efficacy of antidepressants in increasing the response to the treatment (10 studies, 805 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% Cl 1.08 to 1.82). This result became non‐significant after the exclusion of studies at high risk of bias (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.68). There was no difference for other relevant outcomes such as the difference between baseline and final score, evaluated using interviewer‐rated scales (5 studies, 447 participants, SMD 0.15, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.42). Moderate‐quality evidence found that antidepressants increased the number of participants abstinent from alcohol during the trial (7 studies, 424 participants, RR 1.71, 95% Cl 1.22 to 2.39) and reduced the number of drinks per drinking days (7 studies, 451 participants, mean difference (MD) ‐1.13 drinks per drinking days, 95% Cl ‐1.79 to ‐0.46). After the exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, the number of abstinent remained higher (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.43) and the number of drinks per drinking days lower (MD ‐1.21 number of drinks per drinking days, 95% CI ‐1.91 to ‐0.51) among participants who received antidepressants compared to those who eceived placebo. However, other outcomes such as the rate of abstinent days did not differ between antidepressants and placebo (9 studies, 821 participants, MD 1.34, 95% Cl ‐1.66 to 4.34; low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence suggested no differences between antidepressants and placebo in the number of dropouts (17 studies, 1159 participants, RR 0.98, 95% Cl 0.79 to 1.22) and adverse events as withdrawal for medical reasons (10 studies, 947 participants, RR 1.15, 95% Cl 0.65 to 2.04). There were few studies comparing one antidepressant versus another antidepressant or antidepressants versus other interventions, and these had a small sample size and were heterogeneous in terms of the types of interventions that were compared, yielding results that were not informative. Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence supporting the clinical use of antidepressants in the treatment of people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Antidepressants had positive effects on certain relevant outcomes related to depression and alcohol use but not on other relevant outcomes. Moreover, most of these positive effects were no longer significant when studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Results were limited by the large number of studies showing high or unclear risk of bias and the low number of studies comparing one antidepressant to another or antidepressants to other medication. In people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence, the risk of developing adverse effects appeared to be minimal, especially for the newer classes of antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). According to these results, in people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence, antidepressants may be useful for the treatment of depression, alcohol dependence, or both, although the clinical relevance may be modest. Plain language summary Antidepressants for the treatment of people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence Review question This review investigated whether antidepressants reduce the severity of depression or alcohol dependence (or both) in people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Background The co‐occurrence of major depression in people entering treatment for alcohol dependence is common and increases the severity of the condition reducing the effectiveness of treatments. Treatment of these people with medicines is challenging. In this review, we compared the results obtained by people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence treated with antidepressant medicines to those treated with placebo (a sham/pretend treatment) or other treatments. Search date The evidence is current up to July 2017. Study characteristics We identified 33 medical trials involving 2242 participants: 68% were male, and the mean age was 42 years. Most studies compared antidepressants to placebo (22 studies), but some compared one antidepressant to antidepressant (five studies), to another type of medicine (four studies), or to psychotherapy (a talking treatment; two studies). The average duration of the trials was 10 weeks (range 3 to 26 weeks). A total of 18 trials took place in the USA, and the others were in Europe, Turkey, and Australia. The antidepressant used in most of the trials was sertraline; the others were: amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, mianserin, mirtazepine, nefazodone, paroxetine, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and viloxazine. The studies used 49 different rating scales and varied in terms of design, quality, participant characteristics, tested medicines, services provided, and treatments administered. A total of 19 studies reported the source of funding (public funds: six studies; pharmaceutical industry: two studies; both funds: 10 studies). Only four trials reported a declaration of the authors reporting possible conflicts of interest. Key results In the 22 studies comparing antidepressants to placebo, antidepressants may have reduced the severity of depression but we are uncertain whether it increased the number of people with clinical beneficial effects from the reduction of depression severity (response to treatment, i.e. people who halved the severity of depression). However, we found no difference between antidepressants and placebo in other relevant outcomes related to the severity of depression, such as the number of people without depression at the end of the trial (remission). In addition, we found that the administration of antidepressants probably reduced alcohol consumption evaluated as the number of participants abstinent during the treatment (higher among participants who received antidepressants compared to placebo) and the number of drinks consumed per drinking days (lower among participants who received antidepressants compared to placebo). However, similarly to what we found for the severity of depression, we also observed that the administration of antidepressants did not affect other relevant outcomes related to alcohol dependence, such as the rate of abstinent days, number of heavy drinkers, and time before first relapse. In terms of safety issues, the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to side effects (undesirable effects such as dry mouth) may not differ between antidepressants and placebo. There were few studies comparing one antidepressant to another antidepressant or to other interventions, and these had a small number of participants and the same comparison was not made by more than one study, and were therefore not informative. Quality of evidence The quality of the included studies was low or moderate for depression severity, abstinence from alcohol, rate of people withdrawal for medical reasons, and dropouts. In subgroup analyses, in the case of single types of medicines, and comparisons with other medicines, the findings of the review were limited by the small number of available studies. Authors' conclusions There is low‐quality evidence supporting the use of antidepressants in the treatment of people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence. Antidepressants have positive effects on certain relevant outcomes related to depression and alcohol use but not on equally relevant other outcomes. However, the risk of developing side effects appears to be minimal, especially for the newer classes of antidepressants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""Nora""=>[""not in diabetes""]}",10.1002/14651858.CD008581.pub2,"Adult;Alcohol Abstinence [statistics & numerical data];Alcohol Drinking [epidemiology];Alcoholism [complications, *drug therapy];Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use];Depressive Disorder, Major [complications, *drug therapy];Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry);Female;Humans;Male;Placebos [therapeutic use];Psychotherapy;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Alcoholics",,

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the antidepressant drug classes that are most widely used to treat depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in other diseases. Due to many contradictory findings on the adverse effects and toxicities of SSRIs (especially genotoxicities), we reviewed the genotoxic effects of these drugs. Based on the guidelines proposed in the PRISMA statement, we performed a systematic review by searching international electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science to find the published documents on SSRIs and their genotoxic effects from January 1990 to November 2019. After the removal of 203 duplicate articles, 385 articles were screened and 167 articles met the inclusion criteria and qualified for evaluation of their full texts. After this, 26 articles were appropriate for final review. This revealed that the proportion of genotoxicities was highest for citalopram and fluoxetine, with a smaller proportion for sertraline. Limited documentations showed genotoxic and partial genotoxic effects for paroxetine and escitalopram, respectively. Although a number of studies have found genotoxic effects of SSRIs, there are also some factors including doses, duration of exposure, model of experiments, and the type of technique assay that may affect the results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1007/978-3-030-55035-6_8,"Citalopram;DNA Damage;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Humans;Paroxetine;*Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects;Antidepressants;Genotoxicity;SSRIs;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors",,

Most RMDs lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and variable manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Literature on COVID-19 in patients with RMDs, and the effects of various comorbidities on COVID-19 was reviewed. The initial data of COVID-19 infections in RMDs have not shown an increased risk for severe disease or the use of different immunosuppression. However, there are some emerging data that patients with RMDs and comorbidities may fare worse. Various meta-analyses have reiterated that pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, lung disease or obesity predispose to increased COVID-19 mortality. All these comorbidities are commonly encountered in the various RMDs. Presence of comorbidities in RMDs pose a greater risk than the RMDs themselves. A risk score based on comorbidities in RMDs should be developed to predict severe COVID-19 and death. Additionally, there should be active management of such comorbidities to mitigate these risks.

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in treating NAFLD. Methods: Electronic databases were searched until November 2021 for randomized controlled trials. A random-effects model was used to pool continuous outcomes to derive weighted mean difference (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Sixteen randomized-controlled trials were short-listed. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly decreased Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (WMD: 4.33) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (WMD: 3.20) while reducing Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (WMD: 6.96) non-significantly. Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index reported a non-significant association (WMD: 0.06), whereas significant reductions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) percentage (WMD: 2.00) and mean Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score (WMD: 17.77) were observed. Abdominal subcutaneous fat area (SFA) (WMD: 21.58) reduced non-significantly, whereas Abdominal visceral fat area (VFA) (WMD: 26.55) reduced significantly. Body mass index (BMI) (WMD: 0.79), body weight (WMD: 2.80), and HbA1C (WMD: 0.28) showed significant decrease. However, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD: 0.50) and fasting plasma glucose levels (WMD: 4.18) decreased non-significantly. Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in the levels of liver enzymes along with liver and body fat composition and glycemic indices with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.obmed.2022.100437,alanine aminotransferase;aspartate aminotransferase;canagliflozin;dapagliflozin;empagliflozin;fibroblast growth factor 21;gamma glutamyltransferase;glucose;hemoglobin A1c;insulin;liver enzyme;luseogliflozin;proton;sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor;abdominal subcutaneous fat;alanine aminotransferase level;alcoholism;aspartate aminotransferase level;body fat;body mass;body weight;chronic liver disease;comparative effectiveness;depression;diabetes mellitus;diastolic blood pressure;dispersity;fatty liver;Fibrosis-4 Index;gene expression;glucose blood level;glucose transport;glycemic index;histology;homeostasis model assessment;human;hypertension;hypoglycemia;insulin resistance;insulin sensitivity;intra-abdominal fat;intraperitoneal fat;lipid composition;liver biopsy;liver disease;liver fibrosis;metabolic syndrome X;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;nonalcoholic fatty liver;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;obesity;prostate cancer;randomized controlled trial (topic);review;scoring system;sensitivity analysis;subcutaneous fat;systematic review;systolic blood pressure;waist circumference;Symporters;Liver Diseases;Fatty Alcohols;Liver,,

The aims of this review are to investigate the prevalence, causes and major risk factors for MRPs leading to hospitalization in adult patients and to identify the main medicine classes involved. Methods Studies were identified through electronic searches of Medline, Embase, Scopus and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts between January 2000 and May 2013. A systematic review was conducted of both retrospective and prospective studies. Studies included were those involving hospitalization resulting from MRPs in adults (≥18 years old), whereas studies excluded were those investigating drug misuse and abuse and studies investigating MRPs in hospitalized patients. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. Results Forty-five studies were identified, including 21 that investigated hospitalization resulting from adverse drug reactions, six studies that investigated hospitalization due to adverse drug events and 18 studies that investigated hospitalization due to MRPs. The median prevalence rates of hospitalization resulting from adverse drug reactions, adverse drug events and MRPs were 7% (interquartile range, 2.4-14.9%), 4.6% (interquartile range, 2.85-16.6%) and 12.1% (interquartile range, 6.43-22.2%), respectively. The major causes contributing to MRPs were adverse drug reactions and noncompliance. In addition, the major risk factors associated with MRPs were old age, polypharmacy and comorbidities. Moreover, the main classes of medicines implicated were medicines used to treat cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Conclusions Hospitalization due to MRPs had a high prevalence, in the range of 4.6-12.1%. Most MRPs encountered were prevalent among adult patients taking medicines for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1111/bcp.12293,analgesic agent;antidiabetic agent;antiinfective agent;antiinflammatory agent;antineoplastic agent;cardiovascular agent;central nervous system agents;gastrointestinal agent;respiratory tract agent;adverse drug reaction;cohabitation;comorbidity;depression;disease severity;drug efficacy;drug hypersensitivity;drug interaction;drug intoxication;drug monitoring;educational status;hospitalization;human;immobilization;medicine related problem;polypharmacy;prevalence;priority journal;review;risk factor;senescence;sex difference;systematic review;therapy effect;treatment refusal,,

The effect of cognitive impairment on quality-of-life scores was also investigated. Methods: A secondary cross-sectional analysis of data from Wave 1 of the TILDA cohort was undertaken. Results: Prevalence of cognitive impairment ranged between 5.8% and 51.2%, depending on the instrument used (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], respectively). Having hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.08), being a past or current smoker (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.01-1.55) and having low physical activity (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.64-2.53) increased the odds of being classified as cognitively impaired (MMSE <25). Similarly, being obese (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.17-1.47), having hypertension (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.27-1.57), and having diabetes (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.40-2.09) increased the odds of cognitive impairment (MoCA <26). High cholesterol was associated with a protective effect (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.98) under MMSE <25 classification while, problematic alcohol behavior reduced the odds of being classified as cognitively impaired using MoCA <26 by 35% (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.55-0.76). Depression was not associated with increased odds of cognitive decline. Lastly, mean quality of life (QoL) scores decreases as severity of cognitive impairment increases from normal to moderate cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Several modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline were identified, including smoking, low physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of these risk factors in the population might reduce the impact of cognitive decline on public health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.4103/ijnpnd.ijnpnd_59_22,alcohol;cholesterol;adult;aged;alcohol consumption;article;clinical classification;cognitive defect;cohort analysis;comorbidity;controlled study;cross-sectional study;current smoker;dementia;depression;diabetes mellitus;disease association;disease severity;female;groups by age;human;hypertension;lifestyle modification;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;meta analysis (topic);middle aged;Mini Mental State Examination;Montreal cognitive assessment;obesity;physical activity;prevalence;public health;quality of life;retrospective study;risk factor;smoking;very elderly;Quality of Life;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Risk Factors;Prevalence,,

Methods: We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases up to 30 June 2019. We considered all maternal and birth cohort studies conducted in the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE)). We categorized cohort studies on the basis of the exposure(s) (anthropometric, environmental, medical, maternal/reproductive, perinatal, or socioeconomic) and outcome(s) (maternal or birth) being measured. Adjusted weighted effect estimates, in the form of relative risks, between maternal obesity and CS and fetal macrosomia were generated using a random-effects model. Results: Of 3502 citations, 81 published cohort studies were included. One cohort study was in Bahrain, eight in Kuwait, seven in Qatar, six in Oman, 52 in Saudi Arabia, and seven in the UAE. Majority of the exposures studied were maternal/reproductive (65.2%) or medical (39.5%). Birth and maternal outcomes were reported in 82.7% and in 74.1% of the cohort studies, respectively. In Saudi Arabia, babies born to obese women were at a higher risk of macrosomia (adjusted relative risk (aRR), 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.20; I 2 = 50%) or cesarean section (aRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.15-1.26; I 2 = 62.0%). Several cohort studies were only descriptive without reporting the magnitude of the effect estimate between the assessed exposures and outcomes. Conclusions: Cohort studies in the GCC have predominantly focused on reproductive and medical exposures. Obese pregnant women are at an increased risk of undergoing CS delivery or macrosomic births. Longer-term studies that explore a wider range of environmental and biological exposures and outcomes relevant to the GCC region are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1186/s13643-020-1277-0,amniocentesis;anemia;body mass;cesarean section;child health;congenital heart disease;depression;diabetes mellitus;ethnicity;health disparity;human;hyperglycemia;hypertension;insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;low birth weight;macrosomia;maternal care;maternal hypertension;maternal obesity;meta analysis;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;obesity;postpartum hemorrhage;preeclampsia;pregnancy;pregnancy diabetes mellitus;premature labor;priority journal;review;spontaneous abortion;systematic review;Cohort Studies,,

This drug, however, is associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and blood dyscrasias. The manifestations of mental illness may differ between men and women. Yet, there is little evidence on the influence of sex on treatment response or the occurrence of AEs. To fill this gap of knowledge, we carried out a systematic review of the literature on sex differences in the effectiveness and adverse effects of clozapine. Scant evidence has been published on differences in effectiveness of clozapine between men and women. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this issue has only been addressed in a published study. Regarding adverse effects, males have been reported to be more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities such as cholesterol or triglycerides, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk, while females are at a higher risk for gaining weight, developing diabetes, and needing laxatives. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of sex-based studies on this drug, further studies are needed to explore sex-based differences, as the results obtained may be crucial to clinical practice and help improve the quality of life of patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.psychres.2019.112506,clozapine;high density lipoprotein cholesterol;homocysteine;laxative;triacylglycerol;agranulocytosis;bipolar disorder;blood dyscrasia;body mass;body weight gain;cardiomyopathy;cardiovascular risk;constipation;diabetes mellitus;drug blood level;drug efficacy;drug withdrawal;elevated blood pressure;granulocytopenia;human;hyperglycemia;hypertension;leukopenia;metabolic disorder;metabolic syndrome X;myocarditis;neutropenia;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;personality disorder;priority journal;QT prolongation;review;schizoaffective psychosis;schizophrenia;sex difference;side effect;systematic review;Clozapine,,

We included articles focusing on longitudinal studies which evaluated the appearance of depression in diabetic and non diabetic individuals and further analyzed interactions or separate additional influences of potential modifying factors. RESULTS: 8 eligible studies were identified. 6 studies were population based. Only 3 studies analyzed the interaction between the variables of interest and diabetes on the incidence of depression. Remaining used diverse other methods to control for associated factors. The strongest influence was found for a general measure of co-morbidities but this influence was ambiguous. No significant modifying effect or interaction was found for sociodemographic factors.

To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been explored how best to combine both types of data (summary statistics and individual-level data) to optimize polygenic prediction. The most widely used approach to combine data is the meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics (meta-GWAS), but we show that it does not always provide the most accurate PRS. Through simulations and using 12 real case-control and quantitative traits from both iPSYCH and UK Biobank along with external GWAS summary statistics, we compare meta-GWAS with two alternative data-combining approaches, stacked clumping and thresholding (SCT) and meta-PRS. We find that, when large individual-level data are available, the linear combination of PRSs (meta-PRS) is both a simple alternative to meta-GWAS and often more accurate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.04.014,anorexia nervosa;article;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autism;biobank;bipolar disorder;breast cancer;cohort analysis;computer simulation;controlled study;coronary artery disease;female;genetic risk score;genome-wide association study;genotype;human;major depression;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;phenotype;schizophrenia;United Kingdom,,

Methods and analysis We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting sequelae of MDR-TB. We will search PubMed, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science and PsychINFO databases up to 5 September 2017. MDR-TB sequelae will include any clinical, psychological, social and economic effects as well as health-related quality of life that occur after MDR-TB treatment or illness. Two researchers will screen the titles and abstracts of all citations identified in our search, extract data, and assess the scientific quality using standardised formats. Providing there is appropriate comparability in the studies, we will use a random-effects meta-analysis model to produce pooled estimates of MDR-TB sequelae from the included studies. We will stratify the analyses based on treatment regimen, comorbidities (such as HIV status and diabetes mellitus), previous TB treatment history and study setting.

One of the recommended treatment strategies in the international evidence-based guidelines is lifestyle modification, which includes diet and exercise, with the aim of improving a range of health outcomes. The incurable nature of PCOS reinforces the importance of developing novel and innovative symptomatic relief strategies, which are currently the only available approaches for improving quality of life for these women. Women with PCOS tend to be nutrient deficient in many common vitamins and minerals, thought to be associated with the psychological (depression, anxiety, etc.) and physiological (insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, etc.) sequelae of the condition. Nutrient supplementation and the integration of complementary medicine as adjuncts to traditional lifestyle-based therapies in PCOS could therefore provide additional benefits to these women. In this review, we synthesize the evidence regarding nutrient supplementation and complementary therapies in PCOS, predominantly from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to provide an overview of the state of knowledge in this field. The evidence to date suggests that specific vitamins (B-12, inositols, folate, vitamins D, E, and K), vitamin-like nutrients (bioflavonoids and α-lipoic acid), minerals (calcium, zinc, selenium, and chromium picolinate), and other formulations (melatonin, ω-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and cinnamon), as well as some complementary approaches such as acupuncture and yoga may be beneficial in PCOS. However, there remain areas of uncertainty and key limitations in the literature that must be overcome before these therapies can be integrated into routine clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1093/advances/nmab141,*Complementary Therapies;Dietary Supplements;Female;Humans;*Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/complications/drug therapy;Quality of Life;Vitamins/therapeutic use;Pcos;complementary medicine;diet;minerals;nutraceutical;nutrition;polycystic ovary syndrome;review;supplementation;vitamins;Ovary;Complementary Therapies;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,,

Grading of evidence was done according to the GRADE system. Five RCTs and 1 systematic review were identified in patients with IIM and eight RCTs, 6 systematic reviews, and 2 meta-analysis for patients with SLE. Aerobic exercise and resistance training on moderate-high intensity can improve aerobic capacity, muscle impairment, activity limitation, quality of life, and disease activity (limited evidence) in patients with established polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). Moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise can improve aerobic capacity (moderately strong evidence) and improve fatigue and depressive symptoms (limited evidence) without changing disease activity in patients with mild/inactive SLE with low/no organ damage. There is insufficient evidence for effects of exercise in patients with recent onset PM/DM and IBM. Exercise performed in line with American College of Sports Medicine recommendations can improve aerobic capacity, patient-reported outcomes in patients with nonactive PM/DM and mild/inactive SLE.

Articles for a systematic review were obtained via a search performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (1980-2007).Fourteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies indicated that self-reported depressive symptoms markedly impaired HRQOL on several domains. However, depression was not related to all sub-domains of HRQOL in all studies, suggesting that the effects of depression on certain aspects of HRQOL may vary between clinical and demographic subgroups. Although a number of shortcomings identified in the current literature should be taken into account for future research, the importance of this review lies in the possibility it raises that the improvements in HRQOL and clinical practice may potentially be achieved by placing greater attention on the identification and management of depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong study design",10.1002/dmrr.1065,"Adult;Comorbidity;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression/*etiology;Depressive Disorder/etiology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*psychology;Health Status;Humans;*Quality of Life;Surveys and Questionnaires;Quality of Life",,

The prevalence of depression was higher in females with diabetes (23.8%) compared with males (12.8%); however, the odds ratio for depression in patients with Type 2 diabetes compared with those without was higher in males (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.7-2.1) than females (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4). Failure to report potential confounders prevented a more rigorous meta-analysis of risk. CONCLUSION: We identified raised rates of depression in people with Type 2 diabetes, however, there is a need for well-controlled and better-reported studies to inform the development of effective treatments for depression in these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Included"", ""Aly""=>""Included""}",10.1111/j.1464-5491.2006.01943.x,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Depressive Disorder, Major/*etiology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*psychology;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Prevalence",,

Present work was done to cover such gaps in knowledge and emphasize the need for psychological risk factors of MI to be considered while devising prevention guidelines and policies. Original research studies, meta-analyses and systematic reviews focusing on psychological factors in the development of MI were retrieved from databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Elsevier, and Ovid Medline. Psychological factors like depression, anxiety, type A personality, stress, anger, hostility, social isolation and occupational stress were shown to feature consistently as risk factors for MI.

Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of persistent symptoms and signs at least 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 at different follow-up periods. Data sources: Searches were conducted up to October 2021 in Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, and PubMed. Study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions: Articles in English that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and included at least 50 patients with a follow-up of at least 12 weeks after acute illness. Methods: Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to produce a pooled prevalence for each symptom at four different follow-up time intervals. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic and was explored via meta-regression, considering several a priori study-level variables. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for prevalence studies and comparative studies, respectively. Results: After screening 3209 studies, a total of 63 studies were eligible, with a total COVID-19 population of 257 348. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and difficulty concentrating (32%, 25%, 24%, and 22%, respectively, at 3- to <6-month follow-up); effort intolerance, fatigue, sleep disorder, and dyspnea (45%, 36%, 29%, and 25%, respectively, at 6- to <9-month follow-up); fatigue (37%) and dyspnea (21%) at 9 to <12 months; and fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and myalgia (41%, 31%, 30%, and 22%, respectively, at >12-month follow-up). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity for all reported symptom prevalences. Meta-regressions identified statistically significant effect modifiers: world region, male sex, diabetes mellitus, disease severity, and overall study quality score. Five of six studies including a comparator group consisting of COVID-19–negative cases observed significant adjusted associations between COVID-19 and several long-term symptoms. Conclusions: This systematic review found that a large proportion of patients experience post-acute COVID-19 syndrome 3 to 12 months after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19. However, available studies of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome are highly heterogeneous. Future studies need to have appropriate comparator groups, standardized symptom definitions and measurements, and longer follow-up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.cmi.2022.01.014,ageusia;anosmia;anxiety disorder;arthralgia;cognitive defect;cohort analysis;comparative study;concentration loss;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;coughing;decreased appetite;depression;diabetes mellitus;diarrhea;disease association;disease severity;dizziness;drug dependence;dysphagia;dyspnea;Embase;exercise tolerance;fatigue;female;follow up;hair loss;headache;heart palpitation;human;insomnia;long COVID;male;Medline;mood disorder;muscle weakness;myalgia;nausea;Newcastle-Ottawa scale;observational study;prevalence;prospective study;psychosis;publication bias;quality control;rash;retrospective study;review;sex;sleep disorder;smelling disorder;sore throat;symptom;systematic review;taste disorder;thorax pain;vomiting;Prevalence,,

K. and Räsänen, K. and Khan, S. and Lumens, Megl",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013097.pub2,,,,"- Background Occupational lead exposure can lead to serious health effects that range from general symptoms (depression, generalised ache, and digestive signs, such as loss of appetite, stomach ache, nausea, diarrhoea, and constipation) to chronic conditions (cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, kidney disease, cancers, and infertility). Educational interventions may contribute to the prevention of lead uptake in workers exposed to lead, and it is important to assess their effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effect of educational interventions for preventing lead uptake in workers exposed to lead. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and OSH UPDATE to 5 June 2020, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials (RCT), cluster‐RCTs (cRCT), interrupted time series (ITS), controlled before‐after studies (CBA) and uncontrolled before‐after studies that examined the effects of an educational intervention aimed at preventing lead exposure and poisoning in workers who worked with lead, for which effectiveness was measured by lead levels in blood and urine, blood zinc protoporphyrin levels and urine aminolevulinic acid levels. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed studies for eligibility, and extracted data using standard Cochrane methods. We used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess the risk of bias, and GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We did not find any RCT, cRCT, ITS or CBA studies that met our criteria. We included four uncontrolled before‐after studies studies, conducted between 1982 and 2004. Blood lead levels Educational interventions may reduce blood lead levels, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the short‐term after the educational intervention, blood lead levels may decrease (mean difference (MD) 9.17 µg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.14 to 14.20; one study with high baseline blood lead level, 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In the medium‐term, blood lead levels may decrease (MD 3.80 µg/dL, 95% CI 1.48 to 6.12; one study with high baseline blood lead level, 34 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In the long‐term, blood lead levels may decrease when the baseline blood lead levels are high (MD 8.08 µg/dL; 95% CI 3.67 to 12.49; two studies, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but not when the baseline blood lead levels are low (MD 1.10 µg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 2.31; one study, 52 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). Urine lead levels In the long‐term, urinary lead levels may decrease after the educational intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 42.43 µg/L, 95% CI 29.73 to 55.13; one study, 35 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Behaviour change The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of educational intervention on behaviour change. At medium‐term follow‐up after the educational intervention, very low‐certainty evidence from one study (89 participants) found inconclusive results for washing before eating (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 6.91), washing before drinking (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.06), and not smoking in the work area (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.46). Very low‐certainty evidence from one study (21 participants) suggested that employers may improve the provision of fit testing for all respirator users (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.01), and prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, and other tobacco use in the work area (RR 4.25, 95% CI 1.72 to 10.51), however, the results were inconclusive for the adequate provision of protective clothing (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.40). At long‐term follow‐up, very low‐certainty evidence from one study (89 participants) suggested that workers may improve washing before drinking (RR 3.24, 95% CI 1.09 to 9.61), but results were inconclusive for washing before eating (RR 11.71, 95% CI 0.66 to 208.33), and for not smoking in the work area (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0. 8 to 2.50). Very low‐certainty evidence from one study (21 participants) suggested that employers may improve the provision of fit testing for all respirator users (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.63), may provide adequate protective clothing (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.23 to 6.37), and may prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, and other tobacco use in the work area (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.81). Improved knowledge or awareness of the adverse health effects of lead The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of educational intervention on workers' knowledge. At medium‐term follow‐up, questionnaires found that workers' knowledge may improve (MD 5.20, 95% CI 3.29 to 7.11; one study, 34 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). At long‐term follow‐up, there may be an improvement in workers' knowledge (MD 5.80, 95% CI 3.89 to 7.71; one study, 34 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but results were inconclusive for employers' knowledge (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.75; one study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). None of the studies measured the other outcomes of interest: blood zinc protoporphyrin levels, urine aminolevulinic acid levels, air lead levels, and harms. One study provided the costs of each component of the intervention. Authors' conclusions Educational interventions may prevent lead poisoning in workers with high baseline blood lead levels and urine lead levels but this is uncertain. Educational interventions may not prevent lead poisoning in workers with low baseline blood lead levels but this is uncertain. Plain language summary Educational programs and training to prevent lead uptake in workers exposed to lead Background On a daily basis, workers in a wide range of industries come in contact with a harmful metal called lead. There is no known level of exposure to lead that does not cause harm to health, therefore, reducing exposure is essential. Educational programmes and training can prevent the uptake of lead in workers. What is the aim of this review? We searched five databases for randomised (RCT) and non‐randomised studies to assess the effectiveness of these educational programmes. Key messages Educational interventions may prevent lead poisoning in workers but we are very uncertain of this finding, therefore, more studies of better quality are required. What was studied in the review? We included four uncontrolled before‐after studies in this review. The studies assessed the effectiveness of educational interventions for preventing lead uptake in workers exposed to lead. We assessed a critical risk of bias in three studies and a moderate risk of bias in one. What are the main results of the review? Very low‐quality evidence from three studies with participants with high baseline blood lead levels, suggested a decrease in blood lead after education; one study with participants with low baseline blood lead found conflicting results. Very low‐quality evidence from one study suggested a decrease in urinary lead levels. There may be an effect, but we are very uncertain if educational interventions are effective in preventing lead poisoning in workers with high baseline blood lead levels and urine lead levels. For workers with low baseline blood lead levels, the results were inconclusive. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies to 5 June 2020.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD013097.pub2,Poisons;Poisoning,,

A systematic literature review was conducted to provide an overview of published literature in the last 10-years on the epidemiology, humanistic burden and economic burden of PDPN in Europe. METHODS: A search was performed according to pre-defined strategy and review criteria in Embase, Pubmed, and conference proceedings databases from 2003 till December 2012. In total, 30 publications written in English covering the relevant patient population and topics of interest. RESULTS: European prevalence ranges from 6% to 34% in diabetes mellitus patients. PDPN has a significant humanistic and economic impact. Patients are limited in their general functioning and their ability to sleep and often experience anxiety and depression. Not surprisingly, PDPN is associated with reduced Health-Related-Quality-of-Life (HRQoL). PDPN patients incur high health care costs due to hospitalizations and outpatient visits. In addition, the painful symptoms cause impaired work productivity. Studies suggest both humanistic and economic burden increase with higher pain severity. CONCLUSIONS: The burden from PDPN appears to be higher with increasing pain severity. More severe pain leads to a higher impairment in daily functioning, sleep and HRQoL. Higher pain intensity also leads to increasing healthcare costs and work productivity losses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.diabres.2015.04.031,Cost of Illness;*Diabetic Neuropathies/economics/epidemiology/psychology;Europe/epidemiology;*Health Care Costs;Humans;Prevalence;*Quality of Life;Burden;Epidemiology;Europe;Literature review;Painful diabetic neuropathy;Quality-of-life;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,,

This is an update and expansion of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2008. Objectives The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that pharmacological, psychological therapy, non‐invasive brain stimulation, or combinations of these interventions reduce the incidence of diagnosable depression after stroke. Secondary objectives are to test the hypothesis that pharmacological, psychological therapy, non‐invasive brain stimulation or combinations of these interventions reduce levels of depressive symptoms and dependency, and improve physical functioning after stroke. We also aim to determine the safety of, and adherence to, the interventions. Search methods We searched the Specialised Register of Cochrane Stroke and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis (last searched August 2018). In addition, we searched the following databases; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 2018, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2018), Embase (1980 to August 2018), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2018), CINAHL (1982 to August 2018) and three Web of Science indexes (2002 to August 2018). We also searched reference lists, clinical trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); to August 2018 and ClinicalTrials.gov; to August 2018), conference proceedings; we also contacted study authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: 1) pharmacological interventions with placebo; 2) one of various forms of psychological therapy with usual care and/or attention control; 3) one of various forms of non‐invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; 4) a pharmacological intervention and one of various forms of psychological therapy with a pharmacological intervention and usual care and/or attention control; 5) non‐invasive brain stimulation and pharmacological intervention with a pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; 6) pharmacological intervention and one of various forms of psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; 7) pharmacological intervention and non‐invasive brain stimulation with placebo plus non‐invasive brain stimulation; 8) non‐invasive brain stimulation and one of various forms of psychological therapy versus non‐invasive brain stimulation plus usual care and/or attention control; and 9) non‐invasive brain stimulation and one of various forms of psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care plus psychological therapy, with the intention of preventing depression after stroke. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 19 RCTs (21 interventions), with 1771 participants in the review. Data were available for 12 pharmacological trials (14 interventions) and seven psychological trials. There were no trials of non‐invasive brain stimulation compared with sham stimulation or usual care, a combination of pharmacological intervention and one of various forms of psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy, or a combination of non‐invasive brain stimulation and a pharmacological intervention with a pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care to prevent depression after stroke. Treatment effects were observed on the primary outcome of meeting the study criteria for depression at the end of treatment: there is very low‐certainty evidence from eight trials (nine interventions) that pharmacological interventions ecrease the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.68; 734 participants) compared to placebo. There is very low‐certainty evidence from two trials that psychological interventions reduce the proportion of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94, 607 participants) compared to usual care and/or attention control. Eight trials (nine interventions) found no difference in death and other adverse events between pharmacological intervention and placebo groups (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.91; 496 participants) based on very low‐certainty evidence. Five trials found no difference in psychological intervention and usual care and/or attention control groups for death and other adverse events (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.91; 975 participants) based on very low‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions The available evidence suggests that pharmacological interventions and psychological therapy may prevent depression and improve mood after stroke. However, there is very low certainty in these conclusions because of the very low‐certainty evidence. More trials are required before reliable recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments after stroke. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing depression after stroke Review question Do pharmacological, psychological, non‐invasive brain stimulation or a combination of these interventions prevent depression and improve outcomes after stroke? Background The role of interventions for preventing depression after stroke is unclear. Depression is a common and important complication of stroke that is often missed or poorly managed. Little is known about whether prevention strategies started early after stroke will reduce the risk of depression and improve recovery for those not depressed at assessment. Search date We identified trials using searches conducted on 13 August 2018. Study characteristics We included trials which reported on the use of pharmacological and psychological interventions to prevent depression after stroke. Average age of participants ranged from 55 to 73 years. Trials were from Asia (3), Europe (8), North America (5), and Australia (3). Key results We included 19 trials (12 pharmacological and seven psychological) involving 1771 participants. Outcome information was available for nine pharmacological and two psychological trials, which suggested that these treatments might reduce the risk of developing depression. A smaller number of studies (eight pharmacological and five psychological studies) found no increase in death or adverse events. Certainty of evidence We rated the certainty of evidence as very low due to limitations in study design. Conclusion Our ability to generalise these findings to all stroke survivors is limited due to the small proportion of survivors who were eligible to participate in these clinical trials. More well‐designed clinical trials are needed that test practical interventions for preventing depression across all stroke survivors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD003689.pub4,*Psychotherapy;Affect;Aged;Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use];Depression [*prevention & control];Depressive Disorder [*prevention & control];Humans;Middle Aged;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Stroke [*psychology];Brain;Stroke,,

L.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003690.pub5,,,,"- Background Antidepressants may be useful in the treatment of abnormal crying associated with stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and last updated in 2019. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmaceutical treatment in people with emotionalism after stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and three trials registers (May 2022). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing psychotropic medication to placebo in people with stroke and emotionalism (also known as emotional lability, pathological crying or laughing, emotional incontinence, involuntary emotional expression disorder, and pseudobulbar affect). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data from all included trials, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. The primary emotionalism measures were the proportion of participants achieving at least a 50% reduction in abnormal emotional behaviour at the end of treatment, improved score on the Center for Neurologic Study ‐ Lability Scale (CNS‐LS) or Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC), or diminished tearfulness. Main results We did not identify any new trials for this update. We included seven trials with a total of 239 participants. Two trials had a cross‐over design, but outcome data were not available from the first phase (precross‐over) in an appropriate format for inclusion as a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT). Thus, the results of the review are based on five trials with a total of 213 participants. It is uncertain whether fluoxetine increases the number of people who have a 50% reduction in emotionalism when compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.77; P = 0.02; 1 trial, 19 participants) because the certainty of evidence is very low. Sertraline may lead to little to no difference in Center for Neurologic Study ‐ Lability Scale (CNS‐LS) scores and Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC) scores when compared to placebo (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.50; P = 0.12; 1 trial, 28 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Antidepressants probably increase the number of people who experience a reduction in tearfulness (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.86; P = 0.02; 3 trials, 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No trials were found that evaluated the impact of other pharmaceutical interventions. Only two trial authors systematically recorded and reported adverse events, resulting in limited data on the potential harms of treatment. Six trials reported death as an adverse event and found no difference between the groups (antidepressants versus placebo) in the number of deaths reported (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.50; P = 0.61; 172 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). This review provides very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that antidepressants may reduce the frequency and severity of emotionalism. The included trials were small and had some degree of bias. Authors' conclusions Antidepressants may reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes when compared to placebo, based on very low‐certainty evidence. Our conclusions must be qualified by several methodological deficiencies in the trials and interpreted with caution despite the effect being very large. The effect does not seem specific to one drug or class of drugs. More reliable data are required before appropriate conclusions can be made about the treatment of post‐stroke emotionalism. Future trialists investigating the effect of antidepressants in people with emotionalism after stroke should consider developing and using a standardised method to diagnose emotionalism, determine severity, and assess change over time; provide treatment for a sufficient duration and follow‐up to better assess rates of relapse or maintenance; and include careful assessment and complete reporting of adverse events. Plain language summary Medicines for emotionalism after stroke Review question To evaluate the benefits and harms of medicine in people with emotionalism after stroke. Background Emotionalism often occurs after stroke. Emotionalism means that the person has difficulty controlling their emotional behaviour. After stroke, people may suddenly start crying or, less commonly, laughing for no apparent reason. This is distressing for that particular person and their carers. Antidepressants, known to be helpful in people with depression, may be an effective treatment for emotionalism after stroke, but there have been very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this area. (RCTs are studies in which participants are assigned randomly to 2 or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that groups of participants are similar, and that investigators and participants do not know who is in which group.) Search date We identified studies through searches conducted on 26 May 2022. Study characteristics We included 7 randomised controlled trials, involving 239 people with emotionalism, in the review, which reported on the use of antidepressants for treating emotionalism. The numbers of people included in the studies ranged from 10 to 92. The mean/median ages ranged from 57.8 years to 73 years. Studies were from Europe (UK: 1; Denmark: 1; Scotland: 1; and Sweden: 1); Asia (South Korea: 1 and Japan: 1); and the USA (1). Key results We did not identify any new studies in our search update. We included 7 studies involving 239 people. However, 2 studies were not available in the appropriate format to include in the analysis. Therefore, we included only 5 studies, with 213 people, in our analyses. It is uncertain whether antidepressants affect the number of people with at least a 50% reduction in emotional displays, tearfulness, and scores on the questionnaires that measure uncontrollable laughing or crying, but they had no effect on lability (frequency of mood changes) scores and whether a clinician thought there had been an improvement when compared to placebo. No studies of other types of medicine were found. Six studies reported death and found no differences between those who were on antidepressants and those who were not. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low, and the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. Our confidence is limited because the included studies were small, and there was no consistency in how emotionalism was measured across the studies. Conclusion It is uncertain whether antidepressant medicines reduce outbursts of crying or laughing. More studies with systematic assessment and reporting of unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment are needed to ensure that any benefits outweigh the risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD003690.pub5,"*Stroke [drug therapy, psychology];Antidepressive Agents [therapeutic use];Crying [psychology];Emotions;Humans;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Stroke",,

One study was population based, six recruited participants from multiple centres, and the remaining were single centred. The majority of the studies were of low to moderate quality. Factors associated with poor glycaemic control include longer duration of diabetes, low level of education, poor compliance to diet and medication, poor attitude towards the disease, poor self-management behaviour, anxiety, depression, renal impairment, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Healthcare providers should be aware of these factors and provide appropriate education and care especially for those who have poor glycaemic control. Innovative educational programs should be implemented in the healthcare systems to improve patient compliance and practices. A variation in the results of the included studies was observed, and some potentially important risk factors such as dietary habits, physical activity, family support, and cognitive function were not adequately addressed.

Depression is a serious mental condition that decreases mental and physical functioning and reduces the quality of life. Several lines of evidence suggest a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and depression: diabetes patients are twice as likely to experience depression than nondiabetic individuals. In contrast, depression increases the risk of diabetes and interferes with its daily self-management. Diabetes patients with depression have poor glycemic control, reduced quality of life, and an increased risk of diabetes complications, consequently having an increased mortality rate. Conflicting evidence exists on the potential role of factors that may account for or modulate the relationship between diabetes and depression. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the most notable body of literature that dissects the various facets of the bidirectional relationship between diabetes and depression. A focused discussion of the proposed mechanisms underlying this relationship is also provided. We systematically reviewed the relevant literature in the PubMed database, using the keywords ""Diabetes AND Depression"". After exclusion of duplicate and irrelevant material, literature eligible for inclusion in this review was based on meta-analysis studies, clinical trials with large sample sizes (n≥1,000), randomized clinical trials, and comprehensive national and cross-country clinical studies.

Although previous efforts were successful for individual disease conditions (single disease), limited information exists on shared genetic risk between these disorders. This article presents a detailed review and analysis of cardiometabolic diseases risk (CMD-R) genes that are also associated with mood disorders. First, we reviewed meta-GWASs published until January 2016, for the diseases 'type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension' and/or for the risk factors 'blood pressure, obesity, plasma lipid levels, insulin and glucose related traits'. We then searched the literature for published associations of these CMD-R genes with mood disorders. We considered studies that reported a significant association of at least one of the CMD-R genes and 'depression' or 'depressive disorder' or 'depressive symptoms' or 'bipolar disorder' or 'lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder', or 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment response in major depression'. Our review revealed 24 potential pleiotropic genes that are likely to be shared between mood disorders and CMD-Rs. These genes include MTHFR, CACNA1D, CACNB2, GNAS, ADRB1, NCAN, REST, FTO, POMC, BDNF, CREB, ITIH4, LEP, GSK3B, SLC18A1, TLR4, PPP1R1B, APOE, CRY2, HTR1A, ADRA2A, TCF7L2, MTNR1B and IGF1. A pathway analysis of these genes revealed significant pathways: corticotrophin-releasing hormone signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP-mediated or G-protein coupled receptor signaling, axonal guidance signaling, serotonin or dopamine receptors signaling, dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cAMP signaling, circadian rhythm signaling and leptin signaling.

Questions remain regarding the efficacy of additional psychosocial services. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any agonist maintenance treatment versus standard agonist treatment for opiate dependence Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register (June 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6, 2011), PUBMED (1996 to 2011); EMBASE (January 1980 to 2011); CINAHL (January 2003 to 2011); PsycINFO (1985 to 2003) and reference list of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trial comparing any psychosocial plus any agonist with any agonist alone for opiate dependence. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality quality and extracted data. Main results 35 studies, 4319 participants, were included. These studies considered thirteen different psychosocial interventions. Comparing any psychosocial plus any maintenance pharmacological treatment to standard maintenance treatment, results do not show benefit for retention in treatment, 27 studies, 3124 participants, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), abstinence by opiate during the treatment, 8 studies, 1002 participants, RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.37), compliance, three studies, MD 0.43 (95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.92), psychiatric symptoms, 3 studies, MD 0.02 (‐0.28 to 0.31), depression, 3 studies, MD ‐1.70 (95% CI ‐3.91 to 0.51) and results at the end of follow up as number of participants still in treatment, 3 studies, 250 participants, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) and participants abstinent by opioid, 3 studies, 181 participants, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.36). Comparing the different psychosocial approaches, results are never statistically significant for all the comparisons and outcomes. Authors' conclusions For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning. Plain language summary Combined psychosocial and agonist maintenance interventions for treatment of opioid dependence The abuse of opioid drugs and drug dependency are major health and social issues. Maintenance treatments with pharmacological agents can help to reduce the risks associated with the use of street drugs for drug addicts who are unable to abstain from drug use. Methadone is effective in retaining patients in treatment and reducing heroin use but re‐addiction remains as a substantial challenge. Opiate addicts often have psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depression and may not be able to cope with stress. Psychosocial interventions including psychiatric care, psychotherapy, counselling, and social work services are commonly offered as part of the maintenance programs. Psychological support varies from structured psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and supportive‐expressive therapy to behavioural interventions and contingency management.   This review addressed whether a specific psychosocial intervention provides any additional benefit to pharmacological maintenance treatment. The control intervention was a maintenance program, which routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to pharmacological treatment. Present evidence suggests that adding psychosocial support does not change the effectiveness of retention in treatment and opiate use during treatment. Findings on retention in treatment were for 12 different psychosocial interventions including contingency management. These conclusions are based on 34 randomised trials involving 3777 opiate addicts, some 73% of whom were male. All but three studies were conducted in the USA.   The previous version of this review showed a reduction in opiate use during treatment that was no longer the case with the addition of new studies and the same is for the number of participants abstinent at the end of follow up. The psychosocial interventions are likely to require rigorous assessment of any changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning that may indirectly reduce drug use over longer periods of time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population,wrong publication type",10.1002/14651858.CD004147.pub4,"Combined Modality Therapy [methods];Humans;Narcotics [*therapeutic use];Opioid‐Related Disorders [psychology, *rehabilitation];Psychotherapy [*methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",,

This study was performed to determine the prevalence of and associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Latin American (LA) patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. First, a cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 310 Colombian patients with SLE in whom CVD was assessed. Associated factors were examined by multivariate regression analyses. Second, a systematic review of the literature on CVD in SLE in LA was performed. Results. There were 133 (36.5%) Colombian SLE patients with CVD. Dyslipidemia, smoking, coffee consumption, and pleural effusion were positively associated with CVD. An independent effect of coffee consumption and cigarette on CVD was found regardless of gender and duration of disease. In the systematic review, 60 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included. A wide range of CVD prevalence was found (4%-79.5%). Several studies reported ancestry, genetic factors, and polyautoimmunity as novel risk factors for such a condition. Conclusions. A high rate of CVD is observed in LA patients with SLE. Awareness of the observed risk factors should encourage preventive population strategies for CVD in patients with SLE aimed at facilitating the suppression of cigarette smoking and coffee consumption as well as at the tight control of dyslipidemia and other modifiable risk factors. © 2013 Jenny Amaya-Amaya et al.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1155/2013/794383,"antimalarial agent;antinuclear antibody;azathioprine;C reactive protein;complement component C3;complement component C4;creatinine;cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody;cytotoxic agent;hair dye;high density lipoprotein cholesterol;immunoglobulin G;immunoglobulin M;La antibody;low density lipoprotein cholesterol;lupus anticoagulant;methotrexate;mycophenolate mofetil;pesticide;rheumatoid factor;ribonucleoprotein antibody;rituximab;Ro antibody;Sm antibody;steroid;thyroglobulin antibody;thyroid peroxidase antibody;thyrotropin;triacylglycerol;age;alopecia;anemia;arthropathy;article;atherosclerosis;cardiovascular disease;cardiovascular risk;cholesterol blood level;clinical assessment;coffee;comorbidity;creatinine blood level;creatinine clearance;cross-sectional study;depression;discoid lupus erythematosus;disease activity;disease duration;dyslipidemia;education;epilepsy;erythrocyte sedimentation rate;family history;fibromyalgia;gender;glomerulonephritis;hand edema;headache;hepatitis A;heredity;Hispanic;housewife;human;hyperhomocysteinemia;hypertension;inflammation;leukopenia;livedo reticularis;lung embolism;lupus erythematosus nephritis;lymphocytopenia;malaria;nephritis;nephrotic syndrome;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;obesity;occupation;onset age;osteoporosis;peptic ulcer;pericarditis;pleura effusion;prevalence;priority journal;proteinuria;psychosis;pulmonary hypertension;pyuria;sedentary lifestyle;smoking;social status;spontaneous abortion;systematic review;systemic lupus erythematosus;thrombocytopenia;triacylglycerol blood level;vascular disease;vasculitis;venereal disease reaction test;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Cardiovascular Diseases;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,

Objectives Primary objective 1. To assess the effects of providing adult patients with access to electronic health records (EHRs) alone or with additional functionalities on a range of patient, patient‐provider, and health resource consumption outcomes, including patient knowledge and understanding, patient empowerment, patient adherence, patient satisfaction with care, adverse events, health‐related quality of life, health‐related outcomes, psychosocial health outcomes, health resource consumption, and patient‐provider communication. Secondary objective 1. To assess whether effects of providing adult patients with EHR access alone versus EHR access with additional functionalities differ among patient groups according to age, educational level, or different status of disease (chronic or acute). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus in June 2017 and in April 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and cluster‐randomised trials of EHR access with or without additional functionalities for adults with any medical condition. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results We included 10 studies with 78 to 4500 participants and follow‐up from 3 to 24 months. Nine studies assessed the effects of EHR with additional functionalities, each addressing a subset of outcomes sought by this review. Five studies focused on patients with diabetes mellitus, four on patients with specific diseases, and one on all patients. All studies compared EHR access alone or with additional functionalities plus usual care versus usual care only. No studies assessing the effects of EHR access alone versus EHR access with additional functionalities were identified. Interventions required a variety of data within the EHR, such as patient history, problem list, medication, allergies, and lab results. In addition to EHR access, eight studies allowed patients to share self‐documented data, seven offered individualised disease management functions, seven offered educational disease‐related information, six supported secure communication, and one offered preventive reminders. Only two studies were at low or unclear risk of bias across domains. Meta‐analysis could not be performed, as participants, interventions, and outcomes were too heterogeneous, and most studies presented results based on different adjustment methods or variables. The quality of evidence was rated as low or very low across outcomes. Overall differences between intervention and control groups, if any, were small. The relevance of any small effects remains unclear for most outcomes because in most cases, trial authors did not define a minimal clinically important difference. Overall, results suggest that the effects of EHR access alone and with additional functionalities are mostly uncertain when compared with usual care. Patient knowledge and understanding: very low‐quality evidence is available from one study, so we are uncertain about effects of the intervention on patient knowledge about diabetes and blood glucose testing. Patient empowerment: low‐quality evidence from three studies suggests that the intervention may have little or no effect on patient empowerment measures. Patient adherence: low‐quality evidence from two studies suggests that the intervention may slightly improve adherence to the process of monitoring risk factors and preventive services. Effects on medication adherence are conflicting in two studies; this may or may not improve to a clinically relevant degree. Patient satisfaction with care: low‐quality evidence from three studies suggests that the intervention may have little or no effect on patient satisfaction, with conflicting results. Adverse events: two small studies reported on mortality; one of these also reported on serious and other adve se events, but sample sizes were too small for small differences to be detected. Therefore, low‐quality evidence suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on mortality and other adverse events. Health‐related quality of life: only very low‐quality evidence from one study is available. We are uncertain whether the intervention improves disease‐specific quality of life of patients with asthma. Health‐related outcomes: low‐quality evidence from eight studies suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on asthma control, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure, low‐density lipoprotein or total cholesterol levels, body mass index or weight, or 10‐year Framingham risk scores. Low‐quality evidence from one study suggests that the composite scores of risk factors for diabetes mellitus may improve slightly with the intervention, but there is uncertainty about effects on ophthalmic medications or intraocular pressure. Psychosocial health outcomes: no study investigated psychosocial health outcomes in a more than anecdotal way. Health resource consumption: low‐quality evidence for adult patients in three studies suggests that there may be little to no effect of the intervention on different measures of healthcare use. Patient‐provider communication: very low‐quality evidence is available from a single small study, and we are uncertain whether the intervention improves communication measures, such as the number of messages sent. Authors' conclusions The effects of EHR access with additional functionalities in comparison with usual care for the most part are uncertain. Only adherence to the process of monitoring risk factors and providing preventive services as well as a composite score of risk factors for diabetes mellitus may improve slightly with EHR access with additional functionalities. Due to inconsistent terminology in this area, our search may have missed relevant studies. As the overall quality of evidence is very low to low, future research is likely to change these results. Further trials should investigate the impact of EHR access in a broader range of countries and clinical settings, including more patients over a longer period of follow‐up, as this may increase the likelihood of detecting effects of the intervention, should these exist. More studies should focus on assessing outcomes such as patient empowerment and behavioural outcomes, rather than concentrating on health‐related outcomes alone. Future studies should distinguish between effects of EHR access only and effects of additional functionalities, and investigate the impact of mobile EHR tools. Future studies should include information on usage patterns, and consider the potential for widening health inequalities with implementation of EHR access. A taxonomy for EHR access and additional functionalities should be developed to promote consistency and comparability of outcome measures, and facilitate future reviews by better enabling cross‐study comparisons. Plain language summary Adult patient access to electronic health records Do patients manage their healthcare better if they can access their electronic health records? What are electronic health records? Healthcare providers maintain health‐related information about a patient in an electronic health record, which is held in a digital form and is accessed by a computer. Healthcare professionals use these records to access all health‐related information for a patient's care, whenever and wherever they need it. Information may include a person's medical history, medicines, allergies, test results, and immunisation history. Some healthcare providers let patients see their own electronic health records, usually by giving them web‐based access. Patients may also be offered other web‐based services, such as health‐related reminders, secure messaging, and general educational health information. Why we did this Cochrane Review Access to electronic health records might encourage patients to talk wit a healthcare professional about their health and potential treatments, and might help them to take part in decision‐making. We wanted to find out whether access to electronic health records benefits patients or causes any potentially unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at patients’ access to electronic health records. We also looked for studies where access came with extra services. We were interested in changes in: 1. how much patients knew, and understood, about their healthcare; 2. whether patients felt more in control of their care (empowerment); 3. taking medicines, or keeping up with monitoring (prevention) programmes; 4. patients' satisfaction with their care; 5. how patients rated their well‐being (quality of life); 6. patients' health; 7. patients' levels of anxiety, worry, or depression; 8. how often patients used healthcare services (numbers of phone calls or visits); 9. communication between patients and their healthcare providers; and 10. whether patients experienced any unwanted effects. Search date: we included evidence published from 2000 up to April 2020. What we found We found 10 relevant studies, published between 2000 and 2016, that enrolled from 78 to 4500 adults. These studies took place in the USA (seven studies), Canada (two), and Japan (one). Five studies were conducted in doctors' offices and five in hospital clinics. People taking part in the studies were followed up for three months to two years. Two studies were funded in part by pharmaceutical companies. The studies focused on patients with type 2 diabetes (five studies), asthma (one study), glaucoma (one study), congestive heart failure (one study), and hypertension (one study); one study focused on patients who visited their doctor for any reason. Studies compared usual care plus access to electronic health records against usual care alone. In nine studies, access to electronic health records came with extra services. We could not combine study results because of differences in how studies were conducted, types of patients enrolled, and how results were measured, so we had to evaluate them separately. What are the main results of our review? Compared with usual care, we are uncertain whether access to electronic health records affected: 1. patients' knowledge and understanding of diabetes and of blood glucose testing (evidence from one study in 379 patients with diabetes); or 2. how often patients communicated with their healthcare provider (one study in 107 patients). Compared with usual care, access to electronic health records may make little to no difference in: 1. patients feeling empowered (three studies; 601 patients) or satisfied with their care (three studies; 903 patients); or 2. how many patients died or reported serious unwanted effects (two studies; 486 patients). Four studies (in 5466 patients) looked at how well patients kept up with monitoring programmes and continued to take their medicines. Although access to electronic health records may slightly improve keeping up with monitoring programmes, studies assessing how patients continued to take their medications showed different results, so we are unclear about effects of the intervention. Accessing electronic health records may not have affected how often patients used healthcare services (three studies). No studies reported on any unwanted effects nor on whether access to health records may have affected patients' anxiety, worry, or depression. How confident are we about our results? We are not confident in our results because of the small number of studies found. Our search may have missed some relevant studies because of differences in terms used for electronic health records. In addition, we identified limitations in the ways most studies were designed or conducted. Further evidence is likely to change our results. Key messages Access to electronic health records (and extra services) may provide little to no benefit for patients' feelings of empowerment or satisfaction, nor for risk factors for diabetes, car iovascular disease, and high pressure inside the eye (a risk factor for glaucoma). Such access may slightly increase how many patients keep up with monitoring for risk factors. Future studies should use up‐to‐date technologies such as mobile devices to find out: 1. effects of access to electronic health records; 2. for which groups of patients access is most suitable; and 3. which extra services should be included.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD012707.pub2,"*Electronic Health Records [statistics & numerical data];*Patient Access to Records [statistics & numerical data];Adult;Asthma [therapy];Bias;Blood Glucose [analysis];Comprehension;Diabetes Mellitus [blood, diagnosis];Glaucoma [drug therapy];Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Health Services Needs and Demand [statistics & numerical data];Heart Failure [therapy];Humans;Hypertension [therapy];Middle Aged;Patient Compliance;Patient Participation;Patient Satisfaction;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Treatment Outcome",,

Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented. Method: A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic. Results: Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin = 7, ayahuasca = 2, LSD = 1), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion: The resurrection of clinical psychedelic research provides early evidence for treatment efficacy and safety for a range of psychiatric conditions, and constitutes an exciting new treatment avenue in a health area with major unmet needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1111/acps.13249,Bedfont Micro III Smokerlyzer;carbon monoxide gas analyzer;mebufotenin;carbon monoxide;cotinine;lysergide;mescaline;nicotinic acid;placebo;psilocybine;psychedelic agent;acute stress disorder;adjustment disorder;adult;adverse event;alcoholism;anxiety disorder;Banisteriopsis caapi;Beck Depression Inventory;blood pressure monitoring;cancer related anxiety and depression disorder;clinical assessment;clinical outcome;crossover procedure;data extraction;depression;drug dependence;drug effect;drug efficacy;drug safety;DSM-IV;dysthymia;follow up;generalized anxiety disorder;Hamilton Depression Rating Scale;headache;heart rate;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;human;illusion;information retrieval;major depression;Medline;mental disease;mixed anxiety and depression;Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale;mood disorder;nausea;obsessive compulsive disorder;outcome assessment;priority journal;psychopharmacotherapy;psychotherapy;PsycINFO;purging disorder;randomized controlled trial (topic);review;side effect;smoking cessation;systematic review;terminal care;tobacco;tobacco dependence;treatment duration;urine sampling;Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale;Hallucinogens,,

Recent Findings: Patients with AD may have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and neuropsychiatric diseases. The causes of these associations are likely multifactorial and may include genetic predispositions, systemic low-grade inflammation, environmental exposures, medication, and lifestyle and behavioral risk factors. There appears to be geographical variations in prevalence of comorbidities in patients with AD, indicating that differences in ethnicity and lifestyle factors may significantly influence the risk of certain comorbidities. Summary: The reported comorbidities in recent literature emphasize the burden of disease in patients with AD. Early appropriate AD therapy, in combination with reduction of risk factors, may help prevention of certain comorbidities. The reported observations may generate hypotheses for future investigations in underlying risk factors for AD-associated comorbidities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1007/s13671-017-0168-7,"immunosuppressive agent;alcohol consumption;allergy;angina pectoris;anxiety;asthma;atopic dermatitis;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autoimmune disease;blood pressure;brain ischemia;cardiometabolic risk;computed tomographic angiography;coronary artery disease;depression;DNA damage;environmental exposure;genetic predisposition;heart infarction;human;melanoma;meningioma;meta analysis (topic);non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;non melanoma skin cancer;prevalence;priority journal;review;rhinitis;risk factor;smoking;systematic review (topic);Comorbidity;Dermatitis, Atopic;Asthma",,

The purpose of the current review is to summarize PRO implementation in pediatric medical specialty settings. A literature review of PRO implementation in these settings, conceptual issues, value and approach, legal and ethical concerns, as well as a case example of PROA in type 1 diabetes are presented. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant articles published since the most recent Journal of Pediatric Psychology Special Issue on Evidence-Based Assessment in Pediatric Psychology (2008). RESULTS: Thirty-two articles were identified and reviewed. The majority of studies reported that PROA was feasible, did not disrupt clinic flow, identified psychosocial issues warranting intervention, and was acceptable to families and providers. Response to elevated scores and impact on behavioral health referrals varied. CONCLUSION: While many evidenced-based assessment measures are well-validated within pediatric chronic illness groups, the literature regarding implementation of PROs is still emerging. Research findings are promising, with PROs being feasible, acceptable, and leading to increased discussion of psychosocial issues when integrated into pediatric medical settings. Additional research is needed to evaluate the longitudinal impact of PROs and the optimal manner of responding to assessment data, particularly when clinically-elevated. Ultimately, identifying psychosocial issues in pediatric medical settings can promote optimal health and well-being of youth with chronic illness and their families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1093/jpepsy/jsz082,"Adolescent;Adult;Anxiety/diagnosis;Child;Child, Preschool;Chronic Disease/*psychology;Depression/diagnosis;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*psychology;Female;Humans;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;*Patient Reported Outcome Measures;Quality of Life;Young Adult;patient-reported outcomes;pediatric chronic illness;psychosocial screening",,

Depression is associated with hyperglycemia and an increased risk for diabetic complications; relief of depression is associated with improved glycemic control. A more accurate estimate of depression prevalence than what is currently available is needed to gauge the potential impact of depression management in diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and published references were used to identify studies that reported the prevalence of depression in diabetes. Prevalence was calculated as an aggregate mean weighted by the combined number of subjects in the included studies. We used chi(2) statistics and odds ratios (ORs) to assess the rate and likelihood of depression as a function of type of diabetes, sex, subject source, depression assessment method, and study design. RESULTS: A total of 42 eligible studies were identified; 20 (48%) included a nondiabetic comparison group. In the controlled studies, the odds of depression in the diabetic group were twice that of the nondiabetic comparison group (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2) and did not differ by sex, type of diabetes, subject source, or assessment method. The prevalence of comorbid depression was significantly higher in diabetic women (28%) than in diabetic men (18%), in uncontrolled (30%) than in controlled studies (21%), in clinical (32%) than in community (20%) samples, and when assessed by self-report questionnaires (31%) than by standardized diagnostic interviews (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diabetes doubles the odds of comorbid depression. Prevalence estimates are affected by several clinical and methodological variables that do not affect the stability of the ORs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Included"", ""Aly""=>""Included""}",10.2337/diacare.24.6.1069,"Adult;Databases, Bibliographic;Depression/*epidemiology;Depressive Disorder/*epidemiology;*Diabetes Complications;Diabetes Mellitus/*psychology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/psychology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/psychology;Female;Humans;Medline;Male;Morbidity;Prevalence;Research Design;Comorbidity",,

A.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013128.pub2,,,,"- Background Pruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalised pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children. Search methods We searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials. Selection criteria We sought to include randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non‐pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient‐ or parent‐reported pruritus intensity' and 'Adverse events'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Health‐related quality of life', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Depression', and 'Patient satisfaction'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We found there was an absence of evidence for the main interventions of interest: emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids, topical antidepressants, systemic antihistamines, systemic antidepressants, systemic anticonvulsants, and phototherapy. We included one study with 257 randomised (253 analysed) participants, aged 18 to 65 years; 60.6% were female. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of oral serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, once daily for six weeks) compared to placebo for severe chronic pruritus; 25 US centres participated (clinical research centres and universities). All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline), except adverse events, which were monitored throughout. A pharmaceutical company funded this study. Fifty‐five per cent of participants suffered from CPUO, and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). We unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve outcome data from study authors for the subgroup of participants with CPUO. Participants had pruritus for six weeks or longer. Total study duration was 10 weeks. Participants who received serlopitant 5 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS; a reduction in VAS score indicates improvement) compared to placebo (126 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.50); health‐related quality of life (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a higher score indicates greater impairment; 127 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐4.20, 95% CI ‐11.68 to 3.28); and sleep disturbances (people with insomnia measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire‐Insomnia (PSSQ‐I), a dichotomous measure; 128 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01). Participants who received serlopitant 1 mg may have a greater rate of relief of pat ent‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (126 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.54; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 1 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (128 participants; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.47); health‐related quality of life (DLQI; 128 participants; MD ‐6.90, 95% CI ‐14.38 to 0.58); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ‐I; 128 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). Participants who received serlopitant 0.25 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (127 participants; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.77; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 0.25 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.24); health‐related quality of life (DLQI; 127 participants; MD ‐5.70, 95% CI ‐13.18 to 1.78); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ‐I; 127 participants; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.17). The most commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, among others. Our included study did not measure depression or patient satisfaction. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes due to indirectness (only 55% of study participants had CPUO) and imprecision. We downgraded outcomes other than patient‐reported pruritus intensity a further level due to concerns regarding risk of bias in selection of the reported result and some concerns with risk of bias due to missing outcome data (sleep disturbances only). We deemed risk of bias to be generally low. Authors' conclusions We found lack of evidence to address our review question: for most of our interventions of interest, we found no eligible studies. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist serlopitant was the only intervention that we could assess. One study provided low‐certainty evidence suggesting that serlopitant may reduce pruritus intensity when compared with placebo. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant on other outcomes, as certainty of the evidence is very low. More studies with larger sample sizes, focused on patients with CPUO, are needed. Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders may have to rely on indirect evidence related to other forms of chronic pruritus when deciding between the main interventions currently used for this condition. Plain language summary Treatments for pruritus (itching) of unknown cause in children and adults Review question We wanted to investigate the effects of treatment for chronic (lasting longer than six weeks) pruritus (itching) of unknown cause in children and adults. We assessed all treatments, as long as they were compared against each other, placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), a sham procedure, or no treatment (or equivalent, e.g. waiting list). We were particularly interested in assessing safety and itch intensity as reported by the patient or the parent. Background Pruritus, or itching, is an unpleasant sensation that provokes a desire to scratch. It can be caused by diseases of the skin or other parts of the body. We searched the medical literature up to July 2019 to determine the effects of drug and non‐drug therapies (e.g. phototherapy) used for treatment of itching of unknown cause. Study characteristics We included one study (257 participants) that investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of a drug called serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, taken by mouth once daily for six weeks) versus placebo for severe chronic pruritus (participants had a score of 7 cm or higher on the visual analogue scale (VAS)). The age of included participants ranged from 18 to 65; 60.6% were women; 55% suf ered from itching of unknown origin; and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). A pharmaceutical company funded this study, which was undertaken across 25 centres in the United States (clinical research centres and universities). The study lasted 10 weeks in total (six weeks of treatment plus four weeks of post‐treatment follow‐up). We found no eligible studies for the main treatments we sought to assess, which included emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids (a class of steroid hormones) or antidepressants, systemic antihistamines (medicines used to relieve symptoms of allergies) or antidepressants, anticonvulsants (antiseizure drugs), and phototherapy. Key results Participants who received serlopitant at doses of 0.25 mg, 5 mg, and 1 mg may be more likely to experience reduced itch intensity, as reported by the patient, when compared with participants given placebo (low‐certainty evidence). However, for serlopitant 1 mg and 0.25 mg, the range of possible results indicates there may be little to no difference between groups. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant (in the three doses) on side effects, health‐related quality of life, and sleep disturbances due to very low‐certainty evidence. The most commonly reported side effects were sleepiness, diarrhoea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection, among others. All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline) with the exception of adverse events, which were monitored throughout the study. The included study did not report the effects of this drug on depression and patient satisfaction. Certainty of the evidence Certainty of the evidence was low for patient‐reported itch intensity because 45% of participants had an identifiable skin disease and 55% had itch of poorly defined cause. Additionally, the number of study participants was small and there were few occurrences of the outcomes, or results were imprecise or were not meaningful; therefore, the study was at risk of random errors. Certainty of the evidence was very low for three outcomes (adverse events, quality of life, and sleep disturbances) due to additional concerns that measurement of these outcomes was not pre‐planned. Also, no information was available to assess bias from missing data for the outcome of sleep disturbances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD013128.pub2,"Aging [pathology];Emollients [*therapeutic use];Humans;Phototherapy;Pruritus [drug therapy, etiology, *therapy];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Severity of Illness Index;Skin Care [*methods];Skin Cream [*therapeutic use];Treatment Outcome;Pruritus",,

M.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011068.pub2,,,,"- Background Developments in ultrasound assessment of pregnancy has resulted in the increasing diagnosis of antenatal fetal issues. Many structural fetal conditions as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies have the potential for in‐utero treatment to improve both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Procedures such as laser ablation for twin‐twin syndrome or cord occlusion for selective fetal termination require fetal immobilisation. Immobilisation of the fetus can occur through administration of medication to the mother or directly to the fetus. This improves procedural success and reduces the ongoing risk to the pregnancy. Evidence regarding the best medication and mode of delivery helps to ensure the optimal decision is made for both the mother and the fetus. Objectives To assess the effects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (10 May 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (including published abstracts) which compared different classes of medication administered to the mother or fetus to allow in‐utero procedures to be performed. We also included cluster‐randomised trials but excluded cross‐over trials. Data collection and analysis We used the standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. Main results One study with three trial reports met the inclusion criteria. This involved 54 women with a multiple pregnancy. The study was conducted in a tertiary European hospital maternal‐fetal medicine unit and compared remifentanil to diazepam for fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation during fetoscopic surgery. Low‐certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may reduce fetal movement more than diazepam for two outcomes of fetal movement, one of fetal immobilisation at 40 minutes using a visual analogue score (VAS) (where 0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility), and one of gross body and limb movements (score was absolute number of movements), both assessed by a sonographer evaluating a taped ultrasound sequence (mean difference (MD) ‐65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐69.38 to ‐60.62 and MD ‐10.00, 95% CI ‐11.62 to ‐8.38; 1 study, 50 women). Surgeons may also report being more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil rather than diazepam (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low‐certainty evidence). However, maternal respiratory rate may decrease more during the surgical procedure with remifentanil compared with diazepam (MD ‐6.00, 95% CI ‐8.29 to ‐3.71; 1 study, 50 women; low‐certainty evidence). Maternal sedation may also be worse with remifentanil compared with diazepam (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65; 1 study, 50 women; low‐certainty evidence) measured using an observer assessment of alertness/sedation (where a score of < 4 equates to profound sedation and > 4 equates to insufficient sedation). Perinatal mortality and time taken to perform the procedure were not reported in the trial. We prespecified 20 outcomes and planned to use GRADE for 6 of them, all other outcomes were not able to be reported against for the purpose of meta‐analysis due to data not being provided or unable to be interpreted. We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias. Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence indica es that there is low certainty of the evidence. Authors' conclusions We were only able to include one study with a small number of women, from a single centre, a European tertiary hospital. This study was published in 2005 with an abstract of this trial published in 2004. This study evaluated two intravenous medications administered to the mother ‐ remifentanil and diazepam. This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment. Low‐certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure. However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil. Further high‐quality RCTs assessing both fetal and maternal medications are required to evaluate their efficacy for fetal immobilisation as well as safety for both mother and fetus. Plain language summary Drugs given to pregnant women and their babies to keep them still during fetal surgery and other invasive procedures on the baby We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of anaesthetic and pain relief medication for preventing fetal movements (fetal immobilisation) to allow surgical and other invasive procedures to be performed safely on the unborn fetus whilst still in the mother's uterus. What is the issue? Use of ultrasound during pregnancy has made great advances resulting in increased diagnosis of problems with the development of unborn babies. Many structural fetal problems as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies can be treated while babies are still in the mother's uterus. Many problems generally require treatment before birth, for example a blockage in the airways. We set out to determine which medications are effective at providing fetal immobilisation for in‐utero procedures to be performed, as well as looking at the effect on the mother in terms of sedation and pain relief. For these procedures to be performed safely, fetal movements may need to be reduced. This can be done by giving medication either to the mother (usually by injection into a vein) or directly to the fetus (by injecting into fetal muscle). Why is this important? Treatment of structural issues such as lung or heart problems can greatly improve pregnancy and newborn outcomes. Similarly, with multiple pregnancy complications such as twin‐twin transfusion syndrome, where there is unequal sharing of the one placenta between the twins. Providing the best surgical conditions with reduced fetal movements means that the procedure can be performed safely and reduces complications such as preterm birth. It is also important to provide a safe environment for the mother without side effects such as oversedation or lack of pain relief during the procedure. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials to May 2021 and identified one eligible trial involving 54 pregnant women. All were women with a multiple pregnancy in their second trimester attending a European hospital for specialist care. The women received intravenous injection of either remifentanil or diazepam to immobilise the fetus and to sedate the mother during fetoscopic surgery. This is where a small instrument (laparoscope) is inserted through the mother's abdominal wall and into the uterus to see the fetus and placenta. The trial gave low‐certainty evidence. The main outcome looked at was how much the baby moved via assessment of body and limb movements. Maternal outcomes were the amount of sedation and depression of breathing. The time for surgery and surgical satisfaction with the procedural conditions were also measured. Low‐certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements when compared to diazepam and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil. However, the amount of maternal sedation and depression of breathing were worse with remifentanil. What does this mean? Low‐ ertainty evidence from one small trial means that we cannot be confident in the results. The information available on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes was limited. More high‐quality trials are needed to increase our certainty about the longer term fetal and newborn impact of the medication used for fetal immobilisation for in‐utero procedures, as well as other medications which may be suitable for use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD011068.pub2,"*Perinatal Mortality;*Prenatal Care [methods];Diazepam [therapeutic use];Female;Fetus [surgery];Humans;Infant, Newborn;Pregnancy;Remifentanil",,

Our systematic review provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that RLS in children is comorbid with a number of somatic and neuropsychiatric conditions.

Increasing evidence suggests that many risk factors for AD are modifiable. AD pathology develops over decades. Hence risk reduction interventions require very long follow-ups to show effects on AD incidence. Focussing on AD risk, instead of diagnosis, provides a more realistic target for prevention strategies. We developed a novel methodology that yields a global approach to risk assessment for AD for use in population-based settings and interventions. The methodology was used to develop a risk assessment tool that can be updated as more evidence becomes available. First, a systematic search strategy identified risk and protective factors for AD. Eleven risk factors and four protective factors for AD were identified for which odds ratios were published or could be calculated (age, sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, depression, serum cholesterol, traumatic brain injury, smoking, alcohol intake, social engagement, physical activity, cognitive activity, fish intake, and pesticide exposure). An algorithm was developed to combine the odds ratios into an AD risk score. The approach allows for interactions among risk factors which provides for their varying impact over the life-course as current evidence suggests midlife is a critical period for some risk factors. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to assess the risk and protective factors by self-report. Compared with developing risk indices on single cohort studies, this approach allows for more risk factors to be included, greater generalizeability of results, and incorporation of interactions based on findings from different stages of the lifecourse. © 2013 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1007/s11121-012-0313-2,aged;Alzheimer disease;article;female;health survey;human;male;risk factor;very elderly;Alzheimer Disease,,

C. and Lopez, L. and Rubiano, R. and Slyer, J. T.",,eng,,,"REVIEW OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to synthesise the best available evidence on the effectiveness of web-based programs on the reduction of childhood obesity in school age children. BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.[1] The prevalence has increased at an alarming rate globally.[2] The International Association for the Study of Obesity; estimates that up to 200 million school aged children are either overweight or obese, of those 40-50 million are classified as obese. Obesity has negative health impact in childhood, as well as in the long term.Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m). The World Health Organization defines overweight as BMI greater than or equal to 25 and BMI greater than or equal to 30 as obesity. Children two years of age or older with a BMI between the 85 and 94 percentile on age-growth charts are considered overweight; children with a BMI greater than the 95 percentile are considered obese. BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages worldwide. Measures of central obesity such as the waist:hip ratio and waist circumference can provide more robust indices of overall obesity-related health risk than BMI alone. A BMI z-score is a quantitative measure of the deviation of a specific BMI percentile from the mean of that population. A positive z-score indicates a child is heavier than the mean and a negative z-score indicates a child is lighter than the mean. Thus, a z-score compares the BMI of a given child to the BMI distribution for a population of children of the same age and sex.The incidence of obesity has more than doubled since 1980. Overweight and obesity now ranks as the fifth leading global risk for mortality. Sixty-five percent of the world's population lives in countries where childhood overweight and obesity kills more people than being underweight. In addition, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischemic heart disease burden, and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.Childhood obesity continues to be a significant health problem in the United States. There has been a rapid rise in obesity among the school-age population despite efforts made by Healthy People 2010 in promoting weight management and physical activity. These on-going efforts have been extended to be part of the goals for Healthy People 2020. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculated that approximately 17% children between the ages of two to nineteen years of age were at or above the 97 percentile for being obese. These figures are more than three times the anticipated 5% set in the Healthy People 2010 report.Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. In addition to a higher risk of obesity and non-communicable diseases later in life, affected children experience adverse outcomes such as breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and early markers of cardiovascular disease, different forms of cancers, insulin resistance, and psychological effects. Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death, and disability in adulthood. If a child is overweight before eight years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.Child and adolescent obesity is also associated with increased risk of emotional problems. Teens with weight problems tend to have much lower self-esteem and are less popular with their peers. Depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder can also occur as a result of childhood obesity.In addition to the diseases associated with obesity, the economic consequences of obesity are enormous for families, health care systems, and the global economy. Direct medical costs include preventative, diagnostic, and treatment services related to overweight and associated co-morbidities. European nations spend 2-8% of their health care budgets on obesity, equating to 0.6% of their gross domestic product. In the United States, estimates based on 2008 data indicated that overweight and obesity account for $147 billion in total medical expenditure. This shows an increase from the $117 billion spent in the year 2000.While indirect costs of overweight and obesity on society can be significantly higher, they are often overlooked. These costs stem from childhood obesity continuing on to obesity in adulthood, which can then results in income lost from decreased productivity, reduced opportunities and restricted activity, illness, absenteeism, and premature death. In addition, there are high costs associated with the numerous infrastructure changes that societies must make to cope with obese people such as reinforced beds, operating tables and wheel chairs; enlarged turnstiles and seats in in public gathering spaces; and modifications to transportation safety standards.Obesity is reaching pandemic proportions across much of the world, and its consequences are set to impose unparalleled health, financial and social burdens on global society unless effective actions are taken to reverse the trend. Reducing the incidence of obesity in childhood can help children grow into adults with normal body weights and the tools necessary to sustain a health weight.Haerens, et al. explains the importance of school-based programs in dealing with the serious problem of childhood obesity and overweight. The school setting is known as having a powerful influence on student's eating and physical activities. Programs that may have a more positive impact are those that help increase physical activity and promote healthy foods in youth. Previous studies looking at the implementation of diet and exercise programs in schools were effective in changing food habits and increasing physical activity; however, few of these studies showed a reduction in body weight. The Planet Health study, conducted over a period of two years, focused on healthy life style and showed a reduction in obesity in girls but not in boys. The M-span study, a two-year study involving proper diet, exercise, and parental support showed a reduction of BMI only in boys. Haerens, et al. further explains that the above mentioned studies needed to be done in a more personalised manner in order to achieve more positive result; however, they are limited by the time consumption and financial demands necessary to carry out the proposed intervention.Haerens, et al. conducted a two year study of the effect of a program including physical activity, healthy eating, and parental support with a computer-tailored component on BMI and BMI z-score in boys and girls. This intervention resulted in significant reduction in BMI in girls only. Carlson, et al. conducted a 12-month web-based weight loss intervention program which included physical activity and dietary behaviour. The program was found to be a potential low cost method to positively impact public health and health behaviours. Furthermore, 55% of the participants in the intervention group compared with 35% in the control group made an improvement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and diet. Doyle, et al. conducted an randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of an Internet delivered program targeting weight loss on 80 overweight ethnically diverse 12-17 year olds. BMI z-scores were reduced in the intervention group compared with the usual care group post intervention and the intervention group maintained their reduction in BMI z-score at the four month follow up; however, statistical significance was not achieved at the four month follow up due to improvements in weight loss in the usual care group over time.The United States Department of Health and Human Services report of 2009 indicates that school aged children spend an average of 7 hours and 11 minutes per day watching television, using a computer, and playing video games. Using these technology devices as educational tools could have significant impact by increasing knowledge about healthy choices.Web-based technology has become part of our children's life in the last decade providing the foundation to a large number of daily activities. The use of web-based technology may be one method to provide a more personalised intervention to reduce obesity in school-aged children.The search for previously conducted systematic reviews on the effectiveness of web based programs on obesity in children identified a systematic review conducted by An, et al., which included studies published between 1995 and April 2009. A critical appraisal of this systematic review determined it to be of reduced quality due to lack of transparency in reporting the details of the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessment of the primary studies' methodological quality. The proposed systematic review will expand on the prior systematic review using the rigorous search strategy and assessment for methodological quality outlined below to identify the best available research to determine the effectiveness of web-based programs on childhood obesity. The current review will also seek to identify any more current research on the topic while expanding the inclusion criteria from the internet-based interventions included in An, et al. to other forms for web-based technologies, such as smart phones, that have become increasingly popular with this population.The use of the web for communication purposes came into existence in 1991, but it was not really until the mid to late 1990's that information professionals understood its usefulness and the magnitude of a medium that would have far-reaching positive consequences. This systematic review will include studies published from 1991 to the present date to identify all relevant studies on this topic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.11124/jbisrir-2012-248,Only Child;Child,,

G. K.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007297.pub3,,,,"- Background One person in every four will suffer from a diagnosable mental health condition during their life. Such conditions can have a devastating impact on the lives of the individual and their family, as well as society. International healthcare policy makers have increasingly advocated and enshrined partnership models of mental health care. Shared decision‐making (SDM) is one such partnership approach. Shared decision‐making is a form of service user‐provider communication where both parties are acknowledged to bring expertise to the process and work in partnership to make a decision. This review assesses whether SDM interventions improve a range of outcomes. This is the first update of this Cochrane Review, first published in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of SDM interventions for people of all ages with mental health conditions, directed at people with mental health conditions, carers, or healthcare professionals, on a range of outcomes including: clinical outcomes, participation/involvement in decision‐making process (observations on the process of SDM; user‐reported, SDM‐specific outcomes of encounters), recovery, satisfaction, knowledge, treatment/medication continuation, health service outcomes, and adverse outcomes. Search methods We ran searches in January 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (2009 to January 2020). We also searched trial registers and the bibliographies of relevant papers, and contacted authors of included studies. We updated the searches in February 2022. When we identified studies as potentially relevant, we labelled these as studies awaiting classification. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised controlled trials, of SDM interventions in people with mental health conditions (by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results This updated review included 13 new studies, for a total of 15 RCTs. Most participants were adults with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, in higher‐income countries. None of the studies included children or adolescents. Primary outcomes We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve clinical outcomes, such as psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety, and readmission, compared with control due to very low‐certainty evidence. For readmission, we conducted subgroup analysis between studies that used usual care and those that used cognitive training in the control group. There were no subgroup differences. Regarding participation (by the person with the mental health condition) or level of involvement in the decision‐making process, we are uncertain if SDM interventions improve observations on the process of SDM compared with no intervention due to very low‐certainty evidence. On the other hand, SDM interventions may improve SDM‐specific user‐reported outcomes from encounters immediately after intervention compared with no intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.01; 3 studies, 534 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence for sustained participation or involvement in the decision‐making processes. Secondary outcomes We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve recovery compared with no intervention due to very low‐certainty evidence. We are uncertain if SDM interventions improve users' overall satisfaction. However, one study (241 participants) showed that SDM interventions probably improve some aspects of users' satisfaction with received information compared with no intervention: information given was rated as helpful (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.65); parti ipants expressed a strong desire to receive information this way for other treatment decisions (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.68); and strongly recommended the information be shared with others in this way (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.58). The evidence was of moderate certainty for these outcomes. However, this same study reported there may be little or no effect on amount or clarity of information, while another small study reported there may be little or no change in carer satisfaction with the SDM intervention. The effects of healthcare professional satisfaction were mixed: SDM interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professional satisfaction when measured continuously, but probably improve healthcare professional satisfaction when assessed categorically. We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve knowledge, treatment continuation assessed through clinic visits, medication continuation, carer participation, and the relationship between users and healthcare professionals because of very low‐certainty evidence. Regarding length of consultation, SDM interventions probably have little or no effect compared with no intervention (SDM 0.09, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.41; 2 studies, 282 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). On the other hand, we are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve length of hospital stay due to very low‐certainty evidence. There were no adverse effects on health outcomes and no other adverse events reported. Authors' conclusions This review update suggests that people exposed to SDM interventions may perceive greater levels of involvement immediately after an encounter compared with those in control groups. Moreover, SDM interventions probably have little or no effect on the length of consultations. Overall we found that most evidence was of low or very low certainty, meaning there is a generally low level of certainty about the effects of SDM interventions based on the studies assembled thus far. There is a need for further research in this area. Plain language summary Shared decision‐making interventions for people with mental health conditions Shared decision‐making interventions or care as usual: which works better for people with mental health conditions? What are mental health conditions? There are many mental health conditions. They are generally characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviour, and relationships with others. Access to health care and social services capable of providing treatment and social support is key. What did we want to find out? Shared decision‐making is an approach to consumer‐professional communication where both parties (e.g. patients or their carers, or both, together with their clinician) are acknowledged to bring equally important experience and expertise to the process. In this approach, both parties work in partnership to make treatment recommendations and decisions. This approach is considered part of a broader recovery and person‐centred movement within the behavioural health field. The focus on recovery and individual responsibility for understanding and managing symptoms in collaboration with professionals, caregivers, peers, and family members is also fundamental to this approach. Sometimes it also involves a 'decision aid', such as videos, booklets, or online tools, presenting information about treatments, benefits and risks of different options, and identifying ways to make the decision that reflects what is most important to the person. The process of shared decision‐making may often also involve decision coaching by someone who is non‐directive and provides decision support that aims to prepare people for discussion and the decision in the encounter with their practitioner. We wanted to find out if shared decision‐making interventions were better than care as usual for people with mental health conditions to improve: • clinical outcomes, such as psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and readmission; • participation or level of involvement in the decision‐making p ocess. We also wanted to find out if shared decision‐making interventions were associated with any unwanted (harmful) effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that examined shared decision‐making interventions compared with care as usual in people with mental health conditions. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 15 studies involving 3141 adults, from seven countries: Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Care settings included primary care, community mental health services, outpatient psychiatric services, specialised outpatient services such as post‐traumatic stress disorder clinics, forensic psychiatric services, and nursing home wards. The mental health conditions studied were schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder, dementia, substance‐related disorders and multiple clinical conditions, including personality disorder. Care providers included family carers, clinicians, case managers, nurses, pharmacists, and peer supporters. Three studies used an interprofessional collaboration. When people with mental health conditions receive shared decision‐making interventions, we do not know if their clinical conditions change. They may feel that they participated more in decision‐making processes compared with those receiving usual care, although we are uncertain about this when participation was measured in other ways or at later time points after the consultation. People who take this approach probably improve some, but not all, aspects of their satisfaction with received information compared with those receiving usual care. Although it is often suggested that shared decision‐making takes a lot of time, we found that there is probably little or no difference compared with usual care in the length of consultation. We are uncertain about whether shared decision making‐interventions change outcomes such as recovery, carer satisfaction, healthcare professional satisfaction, knowledge, treatment/medication continuation, carer participation, relationship with healthcare professionals, length of hospital stay, or possible harmful effects. Further research is needed in this area. Longer term follow‐up is also needed to better determine the impact of shared decision‐making on: perceptions of quality of life; impact on frequency and severity of crises, hospitalisations, or both; stability of key functions of life, work, housing and overall health; and satisfaction with decision‐making. The review is up to date as of January 2020.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD007297.pub3,*Anxiety;*Mental Health;Adolescent;Adult;Anxiety Disorders;Caregivers;Child;Health Personnel;Humans,,

M. and Dawson, S. and Ness, A. R. and Churchill, R. and Perry, R.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004692.pub5,,,,"- Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole. One potential treatment for MDD is n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3PUFAs), also known as omega‐3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n‐3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta‐analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest different effects of n‐3PUFAs, depending on the severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n‐3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology. Hence it is important to establish their effectiveness in treating MDD. This review updates and incorporates an earlier review with the same research objective (Appleton 2015). Objectives To assess the effects of n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega‐3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, antidepressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait‐list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with trial registries and grey literature sources (to 9 January 2021). We checked reference lists and contacted authors of included studies for additional information when necessary. Selection criteria We included studies in the review if they: used a randomised controlled trial design; provided n‐3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and non‐completion of studies. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. Main results The review includes 35 relevant studies: 34 studies involving a total of 1924 participants investigated the impact of n‐3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n‐3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment. For the placebo comparison, n‐3PUFA supplementation resulted in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) (random‐effects model) −0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.64 to −0.16; 33 studies, 1848 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. An SMD of 0.40 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17‐item) of approximately 2.5 points (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0), where the minimal clinically important change score on this scale is 3.0 points. The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well‐conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate may be biased towards a positive finding for n‐3PUFAs. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64; 24 studies, 1503 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), the confidence intervals include a small decrease to a modest increase in adverse events with n‐3PUFAs. There was no evidence for a difference between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; 8 studies, 609 participants, low‐certainty evidence), response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79; 17 studies, 794 participants; low‐certainty evidence), quality of life (SMD −0.38 (95% CI −0.82 to 0.06), 12 studies, 476 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), or trial non‐completion (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 29 studies, 1777 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence on which these results are based was also very limited, highly heterogeneous, and potentially biased. Only one study, involving 40 participants, was available for the antidepressant comparison. This study found no differences between treatment with n‐3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) −0.70, 95% CI −5.88 to 4.48), rates of response to treatment (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.31), or trial non‐completion (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.71). Confidence intervals are however very wide in all analyses, and do not rule out important beneficial or detrimental effects of n‐3PUFAs compared to antidepressants. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported. Authors' conclusions At present, we do not have sufficient high‐certainty evidence to determine the effects of n‐3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses may suggest a small‐to‐modest, non‐clinically beneficial effect of n‐3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the certainty of the evidence on which this result is based to be low to very low. Our data may also suggest similar rates of adverse events and trial non‐completion in n‐3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. Effects of n‐3PUFAs compared to antidepressants are very imprecise and uncertain. More complete evidence is required for both the potential positive and negative effects of n‐3PUFAs for MDD. Plain language summary Omega‐3 fatty acids for depression in adults Why is this review important? Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by depressed mood or a markedly decreased pleasure or interest in all activities, or both. It has negative impacts on the individual and on society, often over the long term. One possible treatment for MDD is n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3PUFAs), also known as omega‐3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, in some other seafood and in some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest that n‐3PUFAs may impact on depressive symptoms, but a lot of studies have different findings, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Who will be interested in this review? Health professionals, including general practitioners, mental health and psychiatric specialists; individuals with MDD; and the people around them. What questions does this review aim to answer? Do n‐3PUFAs, compared to an alternative, have an effect on depressive symptoms, negative side effects, rates of recovery, quality of life, and rates of study non‐completion, in individuals with MDD? Which studies were included in the review? This review is an update of earlier work (Appleton 2015), using the same methods. We searched scientific databases for all randomised controlled trials in adults with MDD, where individuals received either n‐3PUFAs or an alternative, that were completed up to January 2021. We have included 35 relevant studies: 34 of them involving 1924 people compared the effects of n‐3PUFAs with those of placebo, and one study involving 40 people compared the effects of n‐3PUFAs with those of antidepressants. All studies were of direct relevance to our review, but we considered the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low. What does the evidence from the review tell us? At present, we do not have enough high quality evidence to determine the effects of n‐3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. We found a small‐to‐modest positive effect of n‐3PUFAs compared to placebo, but the size of this effect is unlikely to be meaningful to people with MDD, and we considered the evidence to be of low or very low certainty, with many differences between studies. There was also insufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n‐3PUFAs on negative side effects or numbers not completing studies. What should happen next? We need more evidence, particularly to explain the differences between study findings, e.g. by looking at individuals who may or may not benefit from n‐3PUFAs. Future studies should also compare n‐3PUFAs with usual antidepressant treatment, and investigate the way these treatments may work.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD004692.pub5,"*Depressive Disorder, Major [drug therapy];*Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [therapeutic use];Adult;Antidepressive Agents [therapeutic use];Depression [drug therapy];Humans;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",,

We aimed to systematically assess the association between gestational diabetes and risk of postpartum depressive symptoms by a meta-analysis of cohort studies. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases for studies that investigated gestational diabetes and risk of postpartum depressive symptoms (including diagnosis of postpartum depression) on December 21, 2018. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of the included articles were calculated using the random-effect model and publication bias was detected using the Egger's and Begg's tests. Results: We obtained 10 cohort studies with a total population of 2,000,002. Women with gestational diabetes compared with those without it had a significantly increased risk of developing postpartum depressive symptoms (pooled RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.09–1.60). There was a high degree of heterogeneity across studies (I² = 69.1%, P for heterogeneity = 0.001). The association appeared to be remarkably modified by study design, and the pooled RRs for prospective and retrospective cohort studies were 1.95 (95% CI: 1.48, 2.57) and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.21), respectively (P for interaction = 0.003).

We conducted a 'meta‐umbrella' systematic synthesis of umbrella reviews, which are systematic reviews of meta‐analyses of individual studies, by searching international databases from inception to January 1, 2021. We included umbrella reviews on non‐purely genetic risk or protective factors for any ICD/DSM mental disorders, applying an established classification of the credibility of the evidence: class I (convincing), class II (highly suggestive), class III (suggestive), class IV (weak). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on prospective studies to test for temporality (reverse causation), TRANSD criteria were applied to test transdiagnosticity of factors, and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was employed to address the quality of meta‐analyses. Fourteen eligible umbrella reviews were retrieved, summarizing 390 meta‐analyses and 1,180 associations between putative risk or protective factors and mental disorders. We included 176 class I to III evidence associations, relating to 142 risk/protective factors. The most robust risk factors (class I or II, from prospective designs) were 21. For dementia, they included type 2 diabetes mellitus (risk ratio, RR from 1.54 to 2.28), depression (RR from 1.65 to 1.99) and low frequency of social contacts (RR = 1.57). For opioid use disorders, the most robust risk factor was tobacco smoking (odds ratio, OR = 3.07). For non‐organic psychotic disorders, the most robust risk factors were clinical high risk state for psychosis (OR = 9.32), cannabis use (OR = 3.90), and childhood adversities (OR = 2.80). For depressive disorders, they were widowhood (RR = 5.59), sexual dysfunction (OR = 2.71), three (OR = 1.99) or four‐five (OR = 2.06) metabolic factors, childhood physical (OR = 1.98) and sexual (OR = 2.42) abuse, job strain (OR = 1.77), obesity (OR = 1.35), and sleep disturbances (RR = 1.92). For autism spectrum disorder, the most robust risk factor was maternal overweight pre/during pregnancy (RR = 1.28). For attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), they were maternal pre‐pregnancy obesity (OR = 1.63), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.60), and maternal overweight pre/during pregnancy (OR = 1.28). Only one robust protective factor was detected: high physical activity (hazard ratio, HR = 0.62) for Alzheimer’s disease. In all, 32.9% of the associations were of high quality, 48.9% of medium quality, and 18.2% of low quality. Transdiagnostic class I‐III risk/protective factors were mostly involved in the early neurodevelopmental period. The evidence‐based atlas of key risk and protective factors identified in this study represents a benchmark for advancing clinical characterization and research, and for expanding early intervention and preventive strategies for mental disorders.

Collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety. Search methods We searched the following databases to February 2012: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR‐References and CCDANCTR‐Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years); the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP); ClinicalTrials.gov; and CINAHL (to November 2010 only). We screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety. Data collection and analysis Two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet. Two independent researchers made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration. We combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. Main results We included seventy‐nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review. Studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short‐term (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium‐term (SMD ‐0.28, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long‐term (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41). However, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long‐term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short‐term (SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.44 to ‐0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium‐term (SMD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long‐term (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.34 to ‐0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42). No comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long‐term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Authors' conclusions Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety. Plain language summary Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety Many people suffer from depression and anxiety. These problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life. Depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. ‘Collaborative care’ is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety. It involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems. Collaborative care often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist. The case manager has regular contact with the person and organises care, together with the medical doctor and specialist. The case manager may offer help with medication, or access to a ‘talking therapy’ to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation‐liaison) for depression and anxiety. There were problems with the methods in some of the studies. For example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow‐up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years. A smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life. Patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD006525.pub2,*Interprofessional Relations;Adult;Anxiety [*therapy];Case Management [*organization & administration];Depression [*therapy];Female;Humans;Male;Patient Care Team [*organization & administration];Primary Health Care [organization & administration];Psychiatric Nursing;Psychiatry;Psychology;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Standard of Care;Anxiety,,

Objectives To assess the effects of interventions facilitating RTW for workers with acute or chronic adjustment disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to Issue 4, 2011; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science, all years to February 2011; the WHO trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in March 2011. We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate RTW of workers with adjustment disorders compared to no or other treatment. Eligible interventions were pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem solving therapy), relaxation techniques, exercise programmes, employee assistance programmes or combinations of these interventions. The primary outcomes were time to partial and time to full RTW, and secondary outcomes were severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder, work functioning, generic functional status (i.e. the overall functional capabilities of an individual, such as physical functioning, social function, general mental health) and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies that we deemed sufficiently clinically homogeneous in different comparison groups, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included nine studies reporting on 10 psychological interventions and one combined intervention. The studies included 1546 participants. No RCTs were found of pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. We assessed seven studies as having low risk of bias and the studies that were pooled together were comparable. For those who received no treatment, compared with CBT, the assumed time to partial and full RTW was 88 and 252 days respectively. Based on two studies with a total of 159 participants, moderate‐quality evidence showed that CBT had similar results for time (measured in days) until partial RTW compared to no treatment at one‐year follow‐up (mean difference (MD) ‐8.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐23.26 to 5.71). We found low‐quality evidence of similar results for CBT and no treatment on the reduction of days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐35.73, 95% CI ‐113.15 to 41.69) (one study with 105 participants included in the analysis). Based on moderate‐quality evidence, problem solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced time until partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care (MD ‐17.00, 95% CI ‐26.48 to ‐7.52) (one study with 192 participants clustered among 33 treatment providers included in the analysis), but we found moderate‐quality evidence of no significant effect on reducing days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐17.73, 95% CI ‐37.35 to 1.90) (two studies with 342 participants included in the analysis). Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that CBT did not significantly reduce time until partial RTW and low‐quality evidence that it did not significantly reduce time to full RTW compared with no treatment. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that PST significantly enhanced partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care but did not significantly enhance time to full RTW at one‐year follow‐up. An important limitation was the small number of studies included in the meta‐analyses and the small number of participants, which lowered the power of the analyses. Plai language summary Improving return to work in adults suffering from symptoms of distress Adjustment disorders, characterised by distress symptoms and emotional disturbance as a reaction to a significant life change or stressful life event, are a frequent cause of sick leave among workers. Apart from the negative consequences for the worker, sick leave poses a heavy burden on society due to the loss of productivity of the worker and work disability claims. Different treatments have been developed to help such workers return to work. Our study assessed how effective these treatments are at enabling the sick‐listed worker to return to partial or full‐time work. We searched databases containing articles from different scientific journals and looked for studies that tested whether a certain type of treatment helped the worker to return to work when on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder. We found nine relevant studies. In total, 10 psychological treatments were evaluated and one combined treatment consisting of a psychological treatment and relaxation techniques. We found no studies on pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. The nine studies included in this review reported in total on 1546 participants. Of the 10 psychological treatments, five consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy and five of problem solving therapy, which are commonly used types of treatment for patients with mental health problems. Our results showed that workers on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder can be helped with making their first step back to work (i.e. partial return to work) by treating them with problem solving therapy. On average, workers who are offered problem solving therapy start 17 days earlier with partial return to work compared to workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physician or general practitioner. However, we also found that cognitive behavioural therapy or problem solving therapy does not help the worker return to work with full‐time hours any quicker than workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physicians or general practitioners. These results are based on moderate‐quality evidence, which implies that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results and may change the results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD006389.pub2,"*Return to Work;Absenteeism;Adjustment Disorders [*therapy];Adult;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [*methods];Humans;Problem Solving;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Relaxation Therapy;Stress, Psychological [prevention & control];Time Factors;Adjustment Disorders",,

It is particularly prone to chronification. Depression is identified as chronic when it persists for a period of at least two years. In comparison with patients experiencing episodic depression, chronically depressed patients show younger age of onset, more frequent suicide attempts, and a poorer response to antidepressants. Only 12 % of chronically depressed patients receive psychotherapeutic treatment alongside antidepressants. Cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only form of psychotherapy specially developed for the treatment of chronic depression. This study's aim was to contrast psychotherapy/CBASP with pharmacotherapy/antidepressants with respect to their effectiveness in patients with chronic depression. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify all studies directly comparing CBASP with antidepressants (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library). Results: Only two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about CBASP could be found which included a direct comparison with pharmacotherapy. In addition, a reanalysis could be identified which reevaluated the data of one of the above RCTs with respect to whether there was childhood trauma. The results in the above mentioned studies showed that CBASP is an equally good option to pharmacotherapy with respect to response and remission rates. Conclusions: As the studies on this topic are limited, meta-analytical statistical decisions are difficult. There is, however, indication that adding CBASP to pharmacotherapy could be a good combination for patients with early trauma episodes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.3238/zfa.2017.0017-0023,antidepressant agent;cognitive behavioral therapy;human;major depression;practice guideline;randomized controlled trial (topic);remission;review;systematic review;treatment response;Psychotherapy;Antidepressive Agents;Cognition,,

This review examined the available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture or acupressure to treat PMS. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture or acupressure for women with PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL (from inception to 21 September 2017), two clinical trial databases (from their inception to 21 September 2017), and four electronic databases in China (from their inception to 15 October 2017): Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP information/ Chinese Scientific Journals database and WANFANG. Reference lists from included articles were handsearched. Selection criteria We included studies if they randomised women with PMS and associated disorders (PMDD and late luteal phase dysphoric disorder/LPDD) to receive acupuncture or acupressure versus sham, usual care/waiting‐list control or pharmaceutical interventions mentioned by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD). If acupuncture or acupressure were combined with another therapy, these studies were also included where the additional therapy was the same in both groups. Cross‐over studies were eligible for inclusion, but only data from the first phase could be used. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data from each study. Study authors were contacted for missing information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were overall premenstrual symptoms and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included specific PMS symptoms, response rate and quality of life. Main results Five trials (277 women) were included in this review. No trials compared acupuncture or acupressure versus other active treatments. The number of treatment sessions ranged from seven to 28. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low quality, the main limitations being imprecision due to small sample sizes and risk of bias related to detection bias and selective reporting. Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture Acupuncture may provide a greater reduction in mood‐related PMS symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐9.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐10.71 to ‐7.35, one randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 67, low‐quality evidence) and in physical PMS symptoms (MD ‐9.11, 95% CI ‐10.82 to ‐7.40, one RCT, n = 67, low‐quality evidence) than sham acupuncture, as measured by the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale (DRSP). The evidence suggests that if women have a mood score of 51.91 points with sham acupuncture, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.71 and 7.35 points lower and if women have a physical score of 46.11 points, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.82 and 7.4 points lower.There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the rate of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 7.76, three RCTs, n = 167, I 2 = 0%, very low‐quality evidence). Specific PMS symptoms were not reported There may be little or no difference between the groups in response rates. Use of a fixed‐effect model suggested a higher response rate in the acupuncture group than in the sham group (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.92; participants = 100; studies = 2; I 2 = 82%), but owing to the high heterogeneity we tested the effect of using a random‐effects model, which provided no clear evidence of benefit for acupuncture (RR 4.22, 95% CI 0.45 to 39.88, two RCTs, n = 100, I 2 = 82%, very low‐quality evidence ). Acupuncture may improve quality of life (measured by the HOQOL‐BREF) compared to sham (MD 2.85, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.23, one RCT, n = 67, l ow‐quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatment Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether acupuncture reduces PMS symptoms compared to a no treatment control (MD ‐13.60, 95% CI ‐15.70 to ‐11.50, one RCT, n = 14 ) . No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available on specific PMS symptoms, response rate or quality of life outcomes. Acupressure versus sham acupressure We found low‐quality evidence that acupressure may reduce the number of women with moderate to severe PMS symptoms at the end of the trial compared to sham acupressure (RR 0.64 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 97 women out of 100 in the sham acupressure group had moderate to severe PMS symptoms, the number of women in the acupressure group with moderate to severe symptoms would be 50 to 76 women. Acupressure may improve both physical (MD 24.3, 95% CI 17.18 to 31.42, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence) and mental (MD 17.17, 95% CI 13.08 to 21.26, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence) quality of life. No data were available on adverse events, specific symptoms or response rates. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence available suggests that acupuncture and acupressure may improve both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS when compared to a sham control. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of adverse events.There is no evidence comparing acupuncture or acupressure versus current ISPMD recommended treatments for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Further research is required, using validated outcome measures for PMS, adequate blinding and suitable comparator groups reflecting current best practice. Plain language summary Acupuncture and acupressure for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Review question Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture or acupressure in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Background We wanted to know whether using acupuncture or acupressure therapy was better than receiving sham acupuncture, no treatment or currently recommended pharmaceutical medications for PMS such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ‐ a type of anti‐depressant). Study characteristics We found five randomised controlled trials including 277 women that examined the effect of acupuncture or acupressure in women with PMS. The evidence is current to September 2017. We also ran a smaller search in November 2017 to see if we had missed any recently published studies. Three trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, one compared acupuncture with no treatment and one compared acupressure with sham acupressure. Key results Acupuncture may reduce overall mood and physical PMS symptoms when compared to sham. Acupressure may reduce the number of women having moderate to severe PMS symptoms when compared to sham acupressure. There was not enough evidence to determine the safety of acupuncture or acupressure. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.The main limitations were imprecision due to small sample sizes (too few women in the study) and risk of bias related to blinding (where researchers or participants knew what treatment they were getting).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD005290.pub2,*Acupressure;*Acupuncture Therapy;*Quality of Life;Female;Humans;Luteal Phase [*psychology];Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder [*therapy];Premenstrual Syndrome [*therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Premenstrual Syndrome;Acupressure,,

In the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial, at 1.8-year follow-up, patients aged 80 years and older treated with antihypertensive drug therapy had a 30% reduction in fatal or nonfatal stroke (P = .06), a 39% reduction in fatal stroke (P = .05), a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = .02), a 23% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes (P = .06), and a 64% reduction in heart failure (P < .001). The goal of treatment of hypertension is to lower the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg in older persons and to less than 130/80 mm Hg in older persons with diabetes or chronic kidney disease if tolerated. The selection of antihypertensive drug therapy in persons with associated medical conditions depends on their medical conditions. Large meta-analyses of published trials show that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers do not significantly differ in their ability to lower blood pressure and to exert cardiovascular protection in older and younger persons. If the blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the goal blood pressure, drug therapy should be initiated with 2 antihypertensive drugs. Other coronary risk factors must be treated. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

V. and Nier, L. and Lavrencic, L. and Kifley, A. and Cameron, I. D.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012196.pub2,,,,"- Background Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers or bedsores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. Pressure ulcers are a disabling consequence of immobility. Electrical stimulation (ES) is widely used for the treatment of pressure ulcers. However, it is not clear whether ES is effective. Objectives To determine the effects (benefits and harms) of electrical stimulation (ES) for treating pressure ulcers. Search methods In July 2019 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. We did not impose any restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ES (plus standard care) with sham/no ES (plus standard care) for treating pressure ulcers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE . Main results We included 20 studies with 913 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 26 to 83 years; 50% were male. ES was administered for a median (interquartile range (IQR)) duration of five (4 to 8) hours per week. The chronicity of the pressure ulcers was variable, ranging from a mean of four days to more than 12 months. Most of the pressure ulcers were on the sacral and coccygeal region (30%), and most were stage III (45%). Half the studies were at risk of performance and detection bias, and 25% were at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. Overall, the GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence for outcomes was moderate to very low. Nineteen studies were conducted in four different settings, including rehabilitation and geriatric hospitals, medical centres, a residential care centre, and a community‐based centre. ES probably increases the proportion of pressure ulcers healed compared with no ES (risk ratio (RR) 1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 2.85; I 2 = 0%; 11 studies, 501 participants (512 pressure ulcers)). We downgraded the evidence to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. It is uncertain whether ES decreases pressure ulcer severity on a composite measure compared with no ES (mean difference (MD) ‐2.43, 95% CI ‐6.14 to 1.28; 1 study, 15 participants (15 pressure ulcers) and whether ES decreases the surface area of pressure ulcers when compared with no ES (12 studies; 494 participants (505 pressure ulcers)). Data for the surface area of pressure ulcers were not pooled because there was considerable statistical heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 96%) but the point estimates for the MD of each study ranged from ‐0.90 cm 2 to 10.37 cm 2 . We downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. It is uncertain whether ES decreases the time to complete healing of pressure ulcers compared with no ES (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.41; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 55 participants (55 pressure ulcers)). We downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. ES may be associated with an excess of, or difference in, adverse events (13 studies; 586 participants (602 pressure ulcers)). Data for adverse events were not pooled but the types of reported adverse events included skin redness, itchy skin, dizziness and delusions, deterioration of the pressure ulcer, limb amputation, and occasionally death. We downgraded the evidence to low certainty due to risk of selection and attrition bias and imprecision. ES probably increases the rate of pressure ulcer healing ompared with no ES (MD 4.59% per week, 95% CI 3.49 to 5.69; I 2 = 25%; 12 studies, 561 participants (613 pressure ulcers)). We downgraded the evidence to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. We did not find any studies that looked at quality of life, depression, or consumers' perception of treatment effectiveness. Authors' conclusions ES probably increases the proportion of pressure ulcers healed and the rate of pressure ulcer healing (moderate certainty evidence), but its effect on time to complete healing is uncertain compared with no ES (very low certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether ES decreases the surface area of pressure ulcers. The evidence to date is insufficient to support the widespread use of ES for pressure ulcers outside of research. Future research needs to focus on large‐scale trials to determine the effect of ES on all key outcomes. Plain language summary Is electrical stimulation effective for treating pressure ulcers? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether electrical stimulation (ES; an electrical current applied to the skin) can help heal pressure ulcers. We collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question and found 20 relevant studies. Key messages ES compared with no ES probably increases the proportion of pressure ulcers healed and the rate of pressure ulcer healing (moderate certainty evidence) but its effect on time to complete healing and the surface area of pressure ulcers is uncertain (very low certainty evidence). The most commonly reported side effects of ES were reddening of the skin and discomfort. There is a need for better quality research to determine whether ES is safe and effective. What was studied in the review? Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, bed sores or pressure injuries) are injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissue caused by sustained pressure over bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels or lower back. People with reduced mobility due to age, disability or illness are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. ES is provided by an electrical current that can be applied to the skin in different ways. ES requires the placing of at least two small electrodes on the skin connected to a small battery‐powered device which controls the intensity of the current. ES can be delivered either as a direct or pulsed current. It causes a tingling or vibratory sensation in most people except those who cannot feel due to conditions such as spinal cord injury. We reviewed the evidence about whether ES affects the number of pressure ulcers healed, the size and severity of the pressure ulcers, the time to complete healing, and quality of life. We also wanted to find out about any side effects associated with ES. What are the main results of the review? This review includes the results of 20 randomised controlled trials dating from 1985 to 2018 and involving 913 participants. The average age of participants ranged from 26 to 83 years; 50% were male. Participants had their pressure ulcers for at least four days and in some cases for more than 12 months. The majority of pressure ulcers (60%) were serious and on or adjacent to the buttocks (62%). Studies were conducted in four different settings, including rehabilitation and geriatric hospitals, medical centres, a residential care centre, and a community‐based centre. ES was administered for an average of five hours per week. Studies compared ES plus usual care (e.g. wound dressing, pressure relief, regular turning, nutritional advice and supplements) to no ES (but with usual care). Eight studies out of 20 were funded by a device manufacturer with a vested interest in the results of the studies. Eleven studies that compared ES with no ES indicated that ES probably improves the proportion of pressure ulcers healed (moderate certainty evidence based on 501 participants (512 pressure ulcers)). It is uncertain whether ES decreases pressure ulcer severity on a composite measure (based on 1 study with 15 participants (15 pres ure ulcers)). The effect of ES on pressure ulcer area was not estimable because different studies showed very different results. It is uncertain whether ES decreases the surface area of pressure ulcers (very low certainty evidence based on 494 participants (505 pressure ulcers)). We cannot be certain whether ES has an effect on time to complete healing (very low certainty evidence based on 55 participants (55 pressure ulcers)). The common complications related to ES were skin redness and discomfort (low certainty evidence based on 586 participants (602 pressure ulcers)). Twelve studies also indicated that ES probably increases the rate of pressure ulcer healing (moderate certainty evidence based on 561 participants (613 pressure ulcers)). No studies reported results for quality of life or depression. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2019.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD012196.pub2,Electric Stimulation [*methods];Humans;Pressure Ulcer [*therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Treatment Outcome;Wound Healing;Electric Stimulation;Pressure Ulcer,,

There is a need to review the evidence of only those studies that have been conducted comparing antidepressant efficacy with placebo in primary care‐based samples. Objectives To determine the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in patients (under the age of 65 years) with depression in primary care. Search methods All searches were conducted in September 2007. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register was searched, together with a supplementary search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and PSYNDEX. Abstracts of all possible studies for inclusion were assessed independently by two reviewers. Further trials were sought through searching the reference lists of studies initially identified and by scrutinising other relevant review papers. Selected authors and experts were also contacted. Selection criteria Studies were selected if they were randomised controlled trials of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults. Older patients (over 65 years) were excluded. Patients had to be recruited from a primary care setting. For continuous outcomes the Hamilton Depression scale of the Montgomery Asberg Scale was required. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted using data extraction forms by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. A similar process was used for the validity assessment. Pooling of results was done using Review Manager 5. The primary outcome was depression reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of depression symptoms, using the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6‐8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11‐1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43.. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively) . The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs. Authors' conclusions Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care. Plain language summary Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care Depression in the primary care setting is very common. However, most systematic reviews of antidepressant treatment have included trials conducted in secondary care settings. There has been doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care, and hence the impetus to do this review. Through extensive searches of the literature we found 14 studies conducted in adults (not the elderly) in primary care setting, in which tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were compared against a placebo control group in the treatment of depression. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective for depression. Most of the studies were supported by funds from pharmaceutical companies and were of short duration. There appeared to be more adverse effects with TCAs than with SSRIs, however rates of withdrawal from study medication due to adverse effects were very similar between the two antidepressant classes. Advers effects not leading to medication cessation seemed to be more common with TCAs than SSRIs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD007954,"*Primary Health Care;Adult;Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use];Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic [*therapeutic use];Depression [*drug therapy];Humans;Middle Aged;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Young Adult;Antidepressive Agents",,

M. Martire et al. (see record [rid]2010-23346-010[/rid]). Martire et al. reviewed 25 studies of patients with cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, HIV, and type 2 diabetes and reported that couple-oriented interventions had significant effects on depressive symptoms, marital functioning, and pain. They broadly concluded that couple interventions were more efficacious than patient only psychosocial intervention or usual care. Martire et al. did not report on several key items from PRISMA. Martire et al. stated broadly that methodological improvements are needed in couple-oriented intervention research, but did not document how they arrived at this conclusion or provide information on risk of bias in individual studies. As a result, independent confirmation of the reported results or an assessment of the degree to which results might be influenced by potential bias in original studies would require readers to review individually each of the 25 studies included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analyses are cited more than any other type of study design and are prioritized in practice guidelines. Researchers, peer-reviewers, and journal editors should work to improve adherence to PRISMA standards so that clinicians and policy makers can more confidently interpret results and incorporate evidence-based strategies into practice.

Given that populations in the Caribbean are aging, a focus on policies and programs that reduce the risk of dementia and its risk factors is required. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of dementia in the Jamaican setting attributable to key factors. METHODS: We analyzed the contribution of five modifiable risk factors to dementia prevalence in Jamaica using a modified Levin's Attributable Risk formula (low educational attainment, diabetes, smoking status, depression, and physical inactivity). Four sources of data were used: risk factor prevalence was obtained from the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey, 2008, relative risk data were sourced from published meta-analyses, shared variance among risk factors was determined using cross-sectional data from the Health and Social Status of Older Persons in Jamaica Study. Estimated future prevalence of dementia in Jamaica was sourced from a published ADI/BUPA report which focused on dementia in the Americas. We computed the number of dementia cases attributable to each risk factor and estimated the effect of a reduction in these risk factors on future dementia prevalence. RESULTS: Accounting for the overlapping of risk factors, 34.46% of dementia cases in Jamaica (6548 cases) were attributable to the five risk factors under study. We determined that if each risk factor were to be reduced by 5% -10% per decade from 2010-2050, dementia prevalence could be reduced by up to 14.0%. CONCLUSION: As the risk factors for dementia are shared with several of the main causes of death in Jamaica, a reduction in risk factors by even 5% can result in considerable public health benefit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.3233/jad-200601,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dementia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology;Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology;Educational Status;Female;Health Surveys/*trends;Humans;Jamaica/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;Risk Factors;Sedentary Behavior;Smoking/adverse effects/epidemiology/psychology;Caribbean;Jamaica;dementia;low and middle-income countries;population attributable risk;(https://www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/20-0601r2).

Physical activity (PA) is effective in preventing and managing these conditions in the general population, however individuals with SMI engage in substantially less PA and more sedentary behaviour (SB) compared to healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of intervening to increase PA or reduce SB in SMI populations is unknown. Therefore, we systematically reviewed studies measuring changes in PA or SB following behavioural interventions in people with SMI. A systematic search of major databases was conducted from inception until 1/3/2018 for behavioural interventions reporting changes in PA or SB in people with SMI. From 3018 initial hits, 32 articles were eligible, including 16 controlled trials (CT's; Treatment n = 1025, Control n = 1162) and 16 uncontrolled trials (n = 655). Of 16 CTs, seven (47%) reported significant improvements in PA, although only one found changes with an objective measure. Of 16 uncontrolled trials, 3 (20%) found improvements in PA (one with objective measurement). No intervention study had a primary aim of changing SB, nor did any note changes in SB using an objective measure. In conclusion, there is inconsistent and low quality evidence to show that interventions can be effective in changing PA or SB in this population. Future robust randomized controlled trials, using objectively-measured PA/SB as the primary outcome, are required to determine which behavioural interventions are effective in improving the sedentary lifestyles associated with SMI.

The impacts of ulceration, amputation, use of prostheses, and other complications of diabetes on Quality of Life (QOL) are well studied. Similarly, the impact of QOL on overall health has been studied in some detail. OBJECTIVE: Not as well understood are patient expectations regarding amputation and ulceration, and patient knowledge of these outcomes. Specifically, it is not fully understood how patients view these complications prior to their occurrence. In this review we survey the literature for studies discussing these attitudes. Our objective was to perform a systematic review of the medical literature to understand how patients understand and anticipate the potential negative outcomes of ulceration and amputation. We also aimed to identify areas where there are gaps in patient knowledge, which could be addressed by clinicians. RESULTS: Our study yielded articles regarding impressions of patients with diabetes about their general health and outcomes. However, we did not discover much literature directly concerning attitudes toward catastrophic lower extremity outcomes before they occurred. We also identified that patients lack knowledge of management and complications of diabetes; both of these gaps provide an opportunity to better direct care for such patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.2174/1573399813666170612103814,"*Amputation, Surgical/adverse effects/mortality;Artificial Limbs;Cost of Illness;Depression/epidemiology/psychology;Diabetic Foot/diagnosis/mortality/psychology/*surgery;Emotions;*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Patient Education as Topic;Patients/*psychology;Prosthesis Fitting;*Quality of Life;Social Support;Treatment Outcome;Diabetic foot ulceration;amputation;fatalism;mortality;patient attitudes;patient knowledge;quality of life.;Diabetic Foot",,

This study was conducted to review existing literature to determine whether NAC supplementation can affect inflammatory biomarkers in adults. Methods: Bibliographic databases of Scopus, and PubMed were used for relevant papers published until October 2019. Results were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multi-level models. Cochrane's Q and I-squared (I2) tests were used to determine heterogeneity among studies. Results: Twenty-four RCTs which include 1057 sample size were entered to analysis. NAC doses and intervention duration ranged from 400 to 2000 mg/d, and 1 to 80 weeks, respectively. Oral supplementation of NAC reduced serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) [WMD: −0.61 mg/L, 95% CI: −1.18 to −0.03, P = 0.039, I2 = 79.6%], and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [WMD: −0.43 pg/mL, 95% CI: −0.69 to −0.17, P = 0.001, I2 = 89.3%]. However, the effect of oral NAC supplementation on other inflammatory biomarkers was nonsignificant. Dose-response investigation showed a non-linear association between oral NAC supplementation with CRP. Conclusion: Oral NAC supplementation reduced serum level of CRP and IL-6, but did not affect other inflammatory biomarkers. Nevertheless, more RCTs seems to be required to explore how NAC in different dosage and different routes of administration can affect inflammatory biomarkers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155239,acetylcysteine;biological marker;C reactive protein;intercellular adhesion molecule 1;interleukin 1;interleukin 10;interleukin 17;interleukin 6;interleukin 8;monocyte chemotactic protein 1;tumor necrosis factor;vascular cell adhesion molecule 1;abdominal aortic aneurysm;bipolar depression;bipolar disorder;community acquired pneumonia;continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis;depression;diet supplementation;disease severity;human;meta analysis;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;nonhuman;physical activity;priority journal;protein blood level;randomized controlled trial (topic);review;rheumatoid arthritis;septic shock;systematic review;ulcerative colitis;Biological Markers;Acetylcysteine,,

R. and Emmanuel, T. and Caston, J. and Smith, I.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007736.pub3,,,,"- Background Although highly effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not universally accepted by users. Educational, supportive and behavioural interventions may help people with OSA initiate and maintain regular and continued use of CPAP. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of educational, supportive, behavioural, or mixed (combination of two or more intervention types) strategies that aim to encourage adults who have been prescribed CPAP to use their devices. Search methods Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches are current to 29 April 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed intervention(s) designed to inform participants about CPAP/OSA, to support them in using CPAP, or to modify their behaviour to increase use of CPAP devices. Data collection and analysis We assessed studies to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted independently and were entered into RevMan for analysis. 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed, using the updated 'Risk of bias 2' tool, for the primary outcome, CPAP usage. Study‐level 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed using the original 'Risk of bias' tool. GRADE assessment was performed using GRADEpro. Main results Forty‐one studies (9005 participants) are included in this review; 16 of these studies are newly identified with updated searches. Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores indicate that most participants suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness. The majority of recruited participants had not used CPAP previously. When examining risk of bias for the primary outcome of hourly machine usage/night, 58.3% studies have high overall risk (24/41 studies), 39.0% have some concerns (16/41 studies), and 2.4% have low overall risk (1/41 studies). We are uncertain whether educational interventions improve device usage, as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. We were unable to perform meta‐analyses for number of withdrawals and symptom scores due to high study heterogeneity. Supportive interventions probably increase device usage by 0.70 hours/night (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.05, N = 1426, 13 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence), and low‐certainty evidence indicates that the number of participants who used their devices ≥ 4 hours/night may increase from 601 to 717 per 1000 (odds ratio (OR), 1.68, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.60, N = 376, 2 studies). However, the number of withdrawals may also increase from 136 to 167 per 1000 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.66, N = 1702, 11 studies, low‐certainty evidence). Participants may experience small improvements in symptoms (ESS score ‐0.32 points, 95% CI ‐1.19 to 0.56, N = 470, 5 studies, low‐certainty evidence), and we are uncertain whether quality of life improves with supportive interventions, as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. When compared with usual care, behavioural interventions produce a clinically‐meaningful increase in device usage by 1.31 hours/night (95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, N = 578, 8 studies, high‐certainty evidence), probably increase the number of participants who used their machines ≥ 4 hours/night from 371 to 501 per 1000 (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.41, N = 549, 6 studies, high‐certainty evidence), and reduce the number of study withdrawals from 146 to 101 per 1000 (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98, N = 939, 10 studies, high‐certainty evidence). Behavioural interventions may reduce symptoms (ESS score ‐2.42 points, 95% CI ‐4.27 to ‐0.57, N = 272, 5 studies, low‐certainty evidence), but probably have no effect on quality of life (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 0.95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.26, N = 228, 3 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether behavioural interventions improve apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI), as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. We a e uncertain if mixed interventions improve device usage, increase the number of participants using their machines ≥ 4 hours/night, reduce study withdrawals, improve quality of life, or reduce anxiety symptoms, as the certainty of evidence for these outcomes was assessed to be very low. Symptom scores via the ESS could not be measured due to considerable heterogeneity between studies. Authors' conclusions In CPAP‐naïve people with OSA, high‐certainty evidence indicates that behavioural interventions yield a clinically‐significant increase in hourly device usage when compared with usual care. Moderate certainty evidence shows that supportive interventions increase usage modestly. Very low‐certainty evidence shows that educational and mixed interventions may modestly increase CPAP usage. The impact of improved CPAP usage on daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and mood and anxiety scores remains unclear since these outcomes were not assessed in the majority of included studies. Studies addressing the choice of interventions that best match individual patient needs and therefore result in the most successful and cost‐effective therapy are needed. Plain language summary Do supportive, educational and behavioural interventions improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea? What is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)? Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. People with OSA spend more time in light sleep and less time in deep sleep and consequently experience daytime sleepiness, which may affect their daily life. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a treatment that delivers pressurised air to keep the airway open. CPAP treatment involves a machine with three main parts: a device that fits over nose and mouth, a tube that connects the mask to the device's motor; and a motor that blows air into the tube. Review question We already know that CPAP treats OSA effectively in most people by improving symptoms resulting from OSA. However many people do not use their CPAP machine as much as is recommended. We wanted to look at interventions designed to educate and motivate people with OSA to use their CPAP machines more. Study characteristics We looked at evidence from randomised, parallel‐group, controlled studies. Following a comprehensive literature search and assessment of trials, we included 41 studies (number of participants = 9005). Most people experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and had newly diagnosed OSA. Duration of studies ranged from 28 days to two years. Results We grouped the trials into those that gave people a) education, b) a supportive intervention, c) behavioural intervention, and d) a mixed intervention (using all thee techniques). We found that all types of interventions increase CPAP usage with varying levels of certainty. Behavioural therapy increases machine usage by 79 minutes per night, and ongoing supportive interventions probably increase machine use by about 42 minutes per night. Educational and mixed interventions may potentially improve machine usage, however the certainty of this evidence is very low. We also wanted to look at other outcomes such as daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life, depression, and apnoea hypopnoea index (measurement of pauses in breathing and slow or shallow breathing). Not all included studies consistently examined these other outcomes, however behavioural interventions may reduce daytime sleepiness. Studies generally recruited people who were new to CPAP. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence for improved CPAP adherence varied considerably across studies and study types. We were confident that the behavioural interventions improve adherence for around 70 minutes per night. The quality of evidence for educational, supportive, and mixed interventions was not as strong. The quality of evidence for OSA‐related symptoms including daytime sleepiness, quality of life, anxiety or depression was affected by the low number of studies that measured these outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1002/14651858.CD007736.pub3,"Adult;Bias;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [*methods];Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [instrumentation, *statistics & numerical data];Disorders of Excessive Somnolence [epidemiology];Humans;Motivation;Patient Compliance [*statistics & numerical data];Patient Education as Topic [*methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Reinforcement, Psychology;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive [psychology, *therapy];Time Factors;Continuous Positive Airway Pressure;Sleep",,

U. and Scahill, S.",,eng,,,"Background and objectives: Improved quality of life (QoL) and life expectancy of elderly diabetic patients revolves around optimal glycemic control. Inadequate glycemic control may lead to the development of diabetes-associated complications (DAC), which not only complicate the disease, but also affect morbidity and mortality. Based on the available literature, the aim was to elucidate the vicious cycle underpinning the relationship between diabetes complications and glycemic control. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed to find eligible studies published between 1 January 2000 and 22 September 2018 pertaining to diabetes complications and glycemic control. Results: Initially, 261 studies were retrieved. Out of these, 67 were duplicates and therefore were excluded. From the 194 remaining articles, 85 were removed based on irrelevant titles and/or abstracts. Subsequently, the texts of 109 articles were read in full and 71 studies were removed at this stage for failing to provide relevant information. Finally, 38 articles were selected for this review. Depression, impaired cognition, poor physical functioning, frailty, malnutrition, chronic pain, and poor self-care behavior were identified as the major diabetes-associated complications that were associated with poor glycemic control in elderly diabetic patients. Conclusions: This paper proposes that diabetes-associated complications are interrelated, and that impaired glycemic control aggravates diabetes complications; as a result, patient's self-care abilities are compromised. A schema is generated to reflect a synthesis of the literature found through the systematic review process. This not only affects patients' therapeutic goals, but may also hamper their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and financial status.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.3390/medicina54050073,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cognitive Dysfunction/etiology;Data Mining;Depression/etiology;Diabetes Complications/*etiology;Frailty/etiology;Humans;Hyperglycemia/*complications/*drug therapy;Hypoglycemia/*complications/*drug therapy;Life Expectancy;Malnutrition/etiology;Pain/etiology;Quality of Life;Self Care;cognition;depression;diabetes;frailty;glycemic control;health related quality of life;healthcare professionals;malnutrition;pain;physical functioning;self-care",,

We sought to systematically assess the effect of collaborative care on depression and glycaemia in adults with comorbid depression and diabetes to inform guidelines and practice. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and reference lists of retrieved articles published before August 2013. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on collaborative care (ie, coordinated multidisciplinary model of care) for depression that reported the effects on depression and glycaemic outcomes in adults with comorbid clinically relevant depression and diabetes were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on the mean difference in depression and glycaemic outcomes were extracted and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven RCTs included for review reported effects on depression outcomes in 1895 participants, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level in 1556 participants. Collaborative care significantly improved the depression score (standardised mean difference was -0.32 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.11); I(2)=79%) and HbA1c level (weighted mean difference was -0.33% (95% CI -0.66% to -0.00%); I(2)=72.9%) compared with control conditions. Depression remission did not predict better glycaemic control across studies.

People of South Asian (SA) origin are the largest minority group in the UK and are more likely to have long-term conditions (LTCs) such as diabetes and heart disease. People of SA origin are less likely to recognise symptoms that may represent mental health problems. AIM: To explore how people of SA origin with LTCs understand, experience, and seek help for emotional distress, depression, and anxiety. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of qualitative studies exploring emotional distress in people of SA origin with diabetes or coronary heart disease, within primary and community care settings worldwide. METHOD: Comprehensive searches of eight electronic databases from inception to 1 September 2021 were undertaken. Data extracted included study characteristics, and understanding, experience, and help-seeking behaviour for emotional distress. Thematic synthesis was undertaken. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies was used to assess quality of articles, and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) used to determine the overall strength of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies from 3165 unique citations were included. Three main themes were identified. Understanding of emotional distress: non-medical terminology used, such as 'tension', and a complex relationship between emotional and physical illness. Experiences of emotional distress: multiple forms of inequality, distress at diagnosis of their LTC, cultural factors, and sex differences. Help-seeking behaviour: self-management, support from family, friends, and faith, and inadequate clinical support. CONCLUSION: This review provides a greater understanding of the conceptualisation of emotional distress in the context of LTCs by people of SA origin, to support improvement in its recognition and management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Included"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""}",10.3399/bjgp.2021.0345,Anxiety/epidemiology;Asian People;Depression/epidemiology;Female;Humans;Male;*Psychological Distress;Qualitative Research;*Quality of Life/psychology;distress;general practice;health inequality;long-term conditions;mental health;systematic review;Emotions;Anxiety,,

Two areas permitted meta-analyses: the pooled odds ratio for quitting smoking for those with depression was 0.64 (0.49-0.80) p < 0.001; the pooled difference of glycated haemoglobin for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression was 0.18 (0.06-0.31) p = 0.005. Individual studies showed associations between: schizophrenia and lower probability of having smoking habit recorded; schizoid personality disorder and higher probability of remaining non-smokers after quitting; anxiety and poorer control of type I diabetes; depression, anxiety or schizophrenia and lower probability of having a diagnosis of hypertension; schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and lower use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. CONCLUSIONS: A proactive clinical management, together with further studies, are needed to reduce the CV morbidity and mortality of patients with psychiatric disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1017/s0033291718000302,*Comorbidity;Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/*therapy;Dyslipidemias/epidemiology/*therapy;Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Hypertension/epidemiology/*therapy;*Mental Disorders/epidemiology;Smoking/epidemiology/*therapy;Healthcare disparities;cardiovascular diseases;mental disorders;meta-analysis;risk factors;Risk Factors,,

Studies have shown that nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is associated with improved fetal outcomes, such as lower rates of miscarriage. However, there are limited data on outcomes associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, which have focused on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Recently, studies showed adverse health outcomes, such as a reduction in insulin sensitivity in childhood and increased incidence of psychological disorders in adulthood. The effects of hyperemesis gravidarum in the offspring need to be further examined throughout childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood, so that long-term disease risks can be evaluated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome,wrong population",10.1016/j.ajog.2013.11.035,antibiotic agent;chorionic gonadotropin;glucose;hydrocortisone;insulin;serotonin;somatomedin binding protein 1;thyroid hormone;thyrotropin receptor;adulthood;adverse outcome;antibiotic therapy;anxiety disorder;article;bipolar depression;bipolar disorder;bone mass;cardiovascular disease;child health;congenital disorder;disease association;environmental factor;fetus death;fetus outcome;glucose homeostasis;gonadotropin blood level;Helicobacter infection;human;hyperemesis gravidarum;hyperinsulinemia;insulin resistance;insulin sensitivity;low birth weight;maternal morbidity;maternal mortality;meta analysis (topic);newborn death;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;obesity;pathogenesis;pregnancy outcome;premature labor;priority journal;progeny;relative;serotonin blood level;skeletal muscle;small for gestational age;spontaneous abortion;thyroid hormone blood level;United Kingdom;Hyperemesis Gravidarum,,

Many studies have evaluated the relationship between gestational diabetes (GDM) and postpartum depression (PPD), but contradictory results have been reported. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between GDM and PPD. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on PRISMA Guideline. We searched all the relevant epidemiological studies in international databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Google scholar search engine using the MeSH Keywords in English without time limit until 2018. The heterogeneity of the studies was calculated using the I(2) index and Cochran's Q test. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from each study. The results of the study were analyzed using the random effects model and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies with a sample size of 2,370,958 were reviewed. Meta-analysis results showed that GDM significantly increased the risk of PPD, and RR was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.22-2.07, p = 0.001). The RR for 15 cohort studies, 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 case-control study was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.22-2.28), 1.37 (95% CI: 0.91-2.05), and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.98-1.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GDM can be a risk factor for PPD. Therefore, PPD examination in pregnant women with GDM seems to be necessary.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Excluded"", ""Aly""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1016/j.diabres.2019.01.034,"Case-Control Studies;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression, Postpartum/*psychology;Diabetes, Gestational/*psychology;Female;Humans;Pregnancy;Risk Factors;Gestational diabetes;Postpartum depression;Systematic review and meta-analysis;Diabetes, Gestational",,

This study was performed for evaluating the prevalence of depression in Iranian diabetic patients with meta-analysis method. METHODS: This review study was conducted according to PRISMA checklist for systematic review and meta-analysis studies. Two independent researchers with using Mesh keywords for archive literature was conducted a comprehensive search on the national and international databases including Magiran, IranMedex, SID, Medlib, IranDoc, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Springer, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Google Scholar search engine without any time limit to March 2016. I2 index and Cochran test was used to assess heterogeneity of studies. The data were combined using Random Effects Model by Stata software (ver.11.1). RESULTS: Forty-one studies involving 9.491 diabetic patients were collected in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of depression among Iranian diabetic patients was estimated 61% (95% CI [Confidence Interval]: 55-67). This rate in males and females diabetic was 49.7% (95% CI: 33.9-65.5) and 65.6% (95% CI: 51.8-79.5), respectively. The minimum and maximum depression prevalence was obtained in West (55%) and East (66%) regions of Iran, respectively. 25.8%, 20.5%, 13.8% and 3.6% respectively indicate mild, moderate and severe and very severe depression. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression in diabetic patients in Iran is high. So the routine psychology counseling is necessary to diagnose and treatment of the depression in these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nora""=>""Included"", ""Aly""=>""Included""}",,article;bibliographic database;depression;diabetes mellitus;diabetic patient;disease severity;gender;human;Iran;prevalence;scientific literature;systematic review;Prevalence,,
