- Two datasets are used:
  - Raw data: Includes all extracted studies, still contains duplicates (N = `r nrow(tar_read(tbl))`)
  - Clean data: Removed duplicates of extracted studies (N = `r nrow(tar_read(tbl_clean))`)
- Effect size was pooled for the prevalence of diabetes
- Analysis approach:
  - Raw data: Reproduce the result reported in included reviews, also to measure bias and heterogeneity
  - Clean data: Conduct meta-analysis on a subset of clean data, grouped by year, countries, diagnostic criteria, and psychometric instruments
  - General steps:
    - Extracted studies which 95% CI expands beyond the pooled confidence interval is regarded as outliers
    - Random effect model is fitted for all meta-analysis procedure
    - Subgroup meta-analysis in case of effect size differences when conducting the EDA procedure
    - Meta-regression using subgroup variables as covariates
- **Insight:**
  - Using whole clean data, I found that the prevalence of depression is `r es_all`
  - Meanwhile, EDA procedure resulted in the following mean of prevalence:
    - Grouped by year: `r es_eda["year"]`%
    - Grouped by continent: `r es_eda["continent"]`%
    - Grouped by region: `r es_eda["region"]`%
    - Grouped by diagnostic criteria: `r es_eda["clean_criteria"]`%
    - Grouped by psychometric instrument: `r es_eda["clean_instrument"]`%
  - Considering the number of outliers and differences between EDA result and whole dataset meta-analysis, it appears that subgroup analysis is necessary
  - Results from subgroup analysis in @sec-subgroup-nodrop indicates higher within difference than between difference, implying high variance even within the subgroup
  - Meta-regression indicates a growing prevalence of depression at the rate of `r round(meta_reg$b[2] * 100, 2)`% per year
